NARRATIVE SLIDE #6
RE-ENTRY & SPLASHDOWN
April 17, 1970 | "Hello, Houston, this is Odyssey. It's good to see you again."

=== THE FINAL CHALLENGE ===
GET 142:40:46 - Entry Interface (400,000 ft altitude)
Time: 11:53 AM Houston time
Location: Approaching Earth's atmosphere
Status: All or nothing

=== THE RE-ENTRY CORRIDOR ===
The Physics of Survival:

Target Angle: ~-6.5¬∞ (Apollo 13 aimed for ~-6.2¬∞)
Acceptable Window: -5.25¬∞ to -7.4¬∞ (only ~2.1¬∞ margin!)

Too Shallow (less than -5.25¬∞):
‚Ä¢ Spacecraft SKIPS off atmosphere like stone on water
‚Ä¢ Flung back into space
‚Ä¢ No way to return
‚Ä¢ Crew lost forever

Too Steep (more than -7.4¬∞):
‚Ä¢ Spacecraft BURNS UP from friction
‚Ä¢ G-forces crush crew
‚Ä¢ Heat shield fails
‚Ä¢ Death on live television

The Guidance Computer:
‚Ä¢ Frozen for 4 days at 38¬∞F
‚Ä¢ Restarted against design specifications
‚Ä¢ Now controlling life-or-death trajectory
‚Ä¢ Making thousands of calculations per second
‚Ä¢ Adjusting angle with precision

=== COMMUNICATION BLACKOUT ===
GET 142:40:46 - Entry Interface

Re-entry Begins:
‚Ä¢ Spacecraft hits atmosphere
‚Ä¢ Friction creates plasma sheath
‚Ä¢ Radio waves can't penetrate plasma
‚Ä¢ All communications CUT OFF

Expected Blackout Duration: 3-4 minutes

The World Waits:
‚Ä¢ Mission Control silent
‚Ä¢ Families praying
‚Ä¢ Media holding breath
‚Ä¢ Recovery ships scanning horizon
‚Ä¢ No word from crew

Seconds tick by...
1 minute... 2 minutes... 3 minutes...

Normal blackout should end at 3 minutes...

3 minutes 30 seconds...

Still no signal.

4 minutes...

Still silence.

Mission Control tense‚Äîsomething wrong?

=== 4 MINUTES 24 SECONDS ===
Longer than any previous Apollo mission...

Then...

Jack Swigert's Voice:
"Okay, Joe."

CapCom Joe Kerwin:
"Okay, we read you, Jack!"

CHEERS erupt in Mission Control!
They're alive!
They survived re-entry!

=== PARACHUTE DEPLOYMENT ===
GET 142:48 - Parachute Sequence

Sequence of Events:
1. Drogue chutes deploy (24,000 ft)
   ‚Ä¢ Stabilize spacecraft
   ‚Ä¢ Slow initial descent

2. Main chutes deploy (10,000 ft)
   ‚Ä¢ Three massive orange-and-white parachutes
   ‚Ä¢ Each 83 feet in diameter
   ‚Ä¢ Slow descent to safe splashdown speed

TV Cameras Capture:
‚Ä¢ Three beautiful chutes blooming
‚Ä¢ Odyssey dangling beneath
‚Ä¢ Descending toward Pacific Ocean
‚Ä¢ Global audience watches in real-time

=== SPLASHDOWN ===
Time: 12:07:44 PM Central Time
Date: April 17, 1970
Location: Pacific Ocean
Coordinates: 21¬∞38'24"S, 165¬∞21'42"W
Distance from USS Iwo Jima: 3.5 miles (perfect!)

The Impact:
‚Ä¢ Odyssey hits water
‚Ä¢ Capsule bobs upright
‚Ä¢ Flotation bags deploy
‚Ä¢ All three crew members SAFE

USS Iwo Jima Recovery:
‚Ä¢ Helicopters dispatched immediately
‚Ä¢ Navy divers jump to attach flotation collar
‚Ä¢ Crew hatch opens
‚Ä¢ Fresh air!

=== THE CREW EMERGES ===
Recovery Sequence:

Fred Haise (first out):
‚Ä¢ Kidney infection, fever
‚Ä¢ Dehydrated, weak
‚Ä¢ But walking

Jim Lovell (second):
‚Ä¢ Exhausted but smiling
‚Ä¢ Waving to cameras
‚Ä¢ Relief visible

Jack Swigert (last):
‚Ä¢ Dehydrated, tired
‚Ä¢ Grateful to be alive
‚Ä¢ Still can't believe they made it

Medical Assessment:
‚Ä¢ Weight loss: 31.5 pounds combined
  - Lovell: 14 lbs
  - Haise: 6 lbs (kidney infection limited appetite)
  - Swigert: 5 lbs
‚Ä¢ Severe dehydration (all crew)
‚Ä¢ Hypothermia (all crew)
‚Ä¢ Fred Haise: Kidney infection with fever (103¬∞F)
‚Ä¢ Minor injuries and frostbite
‚Ä¢ BUT ALIVE

=== MISSION STATISTICS ===
Total Mission Duration: 5 days, 22 hours, 54 minutes
Distance Traveled: ~622,000 miles total
Closest Approach to Moon: ~158 miles (254 km)
Peak Velocity: ~25,000 mph
Temperature in LM: 38¬∞F minimum
Water Ration: 6 oz/day per person
Weight Loss: 31.5 lbs combined
Survival: 100% ‚úÖ

=== THE WORLD CELEBRATES ===
Global Reaction:
‚Ä¢ Churches ring bells in celebration
‚Ä¢ President Nixon calls crew aboard Iwo Jima
‚Ä¢ Ticker tape parades planned
‚Ä¢ "Successful failure" becomes iconic phrase

Mission Control:
‚Ä¢ Gene Kranz: "I wasn't about to lose those guys."
‚Ä¢ Controllers exhausted but triumphant
‚Ä¢ Problem-solving under pressure saved lives
‚Ä¢ Every simulation, every backup plan paid off

The Message:
‚Ä¢ Teamwork saved three lives
‚Ä¢ Ingenuity overcame impossible odds
‚Ä¢ Calm problem-solving under pressure
‚Ä¢ Never give up

=== GENE KRANZ'S WORDS ===
"Failure is not an option."

Though he never said exactly those words during Apollo 13, the spirit was real:
‚Ä¢ Work the problem
‚Ä¢ Stay calm
‚Ä¢ Don't make it worse by guessing
‚Ä¢ Trust your team
‚Ä¢ Never give up

=== THE FINAL WORDS ===
Jim Lovell (after splashdown):
"We just put Sir Isaac Newton in the driver's seat."

Translation: The physics worked. The math worked. The people worked.

And three men came home alive.

=== LESSONS LEARNED ===
From the Explosion:
‚Ä¢ Redesign oxygen tanks (new safety features)
‚Ä¢ Add third oxygen tank for redundancy
‚Ä¢ Improve wiring insulation
‚Ä¢ Better testing procedures

From the Rescue:
‚Ä¢ LM as lifeboat validated
‚Ä¢ Backup procedures now standard
‚Ä¢ Emergency checklists expanded
‚Ä¢ Training for improbable scenarios

From the Crew:
‚Ä¢ Teamwork under pressure
‚Ä¢ Trust the people on the ground
‚Ä¢ Stay calm, work the problem
‚Ä¢ Improvise when necessary
‚Ä¢ Never give up hope

Apollo 13: The most successful failure in NASA history.
