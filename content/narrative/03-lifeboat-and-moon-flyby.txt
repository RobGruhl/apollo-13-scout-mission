NARRATIVE SLIDE #3
LIFEBOAT & MOON FLYBY
April 13-14, 1970 | Aquarius Becomes Home

=== AFTER THE EXPLOSION ===
GET ~56:00:00 - The Decision
• Command Module "Odyssey" dying—oxygen nearly gone
• Must power down CM to save batteries for re-entry
• Only option: Lunar Module "Aquarius" as lifeboat
• Problem: LM designed for 2 people for 2 days
• Reality: Must support 3 people for 4+ days

=== MOVING TO THE LM ===
Crew squeezes into "Aquarius"
• Cramped: ~160 cubic feet (like a walk-in closet)
• Designed for standing room, not living quarters
• Three grown men in space suits
• Moving one arm disturbs the other two
• No privacy, no comfort, no sleep

Lovell: "Aquarius, this is Houston. You are GO for undocking."
But they're NOT undocking—they're living in it!

=== THE LIFEBOAT ===
What Aquarius provides:
✅ Oxygen reserves (enough for 3... barely)
✅ Battery power (conserve every amp)
✅ Descent engine (for course corrections)
✅ Life support systems (running overtime)

What it doesn't provide:
❌ Warmth (temperature drops to 38°F)
❌ Space (extremely cramped)
❌ Comfort (condensation on walls, no sleep)
❌ Certainty (designed for 2 for 2, not 3 for 4)

=== SWINGING AROUND THE MOON ===
GET 61:29:42 - Free-Return Trajectory Burn
• DPS burn (~31 seconds) using LM descent engine
• Put spacecraft back on free-return path
• Will loop behind Moon and head home
• Safer than trying to turn around
• Must wait... but they'll get home

Day 4 - April 14, 1970
Closest Approach to Moon: ~137 nautical miles (~158 miles / ~254 km)

Through the LM window:
• Lunar surface rushing below
• Pericynthion (closest point to Moon)
• Should have been landing at Fra Mauro right now
• Instead, just passing by for survival

Communication Blackout:
• Spacecraft passes behind Moon
• No radio contact with Earth
• Minutes of silence
• Families hold their breath
• Signal returns—they're alive!

=== THE PC+2 BURN ===
GET 79:27:40 - Speed Up Burn
• Major burn 2 hours after pericynthion
• LM descent engine fires for 4½-5 minutes
• Adds ~900 ft/s velocity
• Shortens trip by ~9-10 hours
• Targets Pacific recovery zone near USS Iwo Jima

Crew hears the engine:
• Longest burn yet in damaged spacecraft
• Engine performs flawlessly
• Trajectory set for Pacific Ocean
• Now it's a race against time

=== SURVIVAL CONDITIONS ===
Temperature: 38-50°F (freezing)
• Water condensation on every surface
• Ice forming on equipment
• Crew shivering constantly
• Can see their breath

Water Rations: 6 oz per person per day
• Normal: 64 oz (8 cups)
• Now: Less than 1 cup total
• Severe dehydration setting in
• Haise developing kidney infection

Power Conservation:
• Minimal heaters (too cold to sleep)
• Minimal lights (stumbling in dark)
• Minimal communications (families terrified)
• Every amp-hour counts for re-entry

Sleep Deprivation:
• Impossible to sleep in cramped, freezing LM
• Constant stress and worry
• Moving disturbs others
• Exhaustion building

=== THE LONG WAIT BEGINS ===
Current position: Behind Moon, heading home
Time to Earth: ~3.5 days
Status: Alive but suffering
Challenges ahead:
• CO2 levels rising
• Water running out
• Batteries draining
• Temperature dropping
• Crew weakening

But Aquarius is keeping them alive.
