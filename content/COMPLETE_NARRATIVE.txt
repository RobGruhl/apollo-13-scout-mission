"Apollo 13: A Successful Failure"
NARRATIVE SLIDE #2
THE EXPLOSION
April 13, 1970 | "Houston, we've had a problem"

=== THE SETUP ===
Day 3 - April 13, 1970
GET 55:54:53 (~9:08 PM Houston time)
Distance from Earth: ~200,000 miles
Speed: ~24,000 mph (traveling away from Earth)
Status: All systems normal, routine evening

=== THE ROUTINE REQUEST ===
Mission Control to Jack Swigert:
"We'd like you to stir up your cryo tanks"

Standard procedure:
• Stir oxygen tanks to get accurate readings
• Oxygen stored as supercold liquid
• Fans stir tanks to prevent stratification
• Done dozens of times on previous missions
• Should take 10 seconds...

=== 55:54:53 - BANG ===
Swigert flips the switch...

LOUD BANG
Spacecraft shakes violently
Master alarm sounds
Warning lights everywhere
Crew feels the ship lurch

Jack Swigert: "Okay, Houston, we've had a problem here"
Houston: "Say again please"
Jim Lovell: "Houston, we've had a problem"

=== WHAT THEY SAW ===
Through the window:
• "Sparklies" - glittering debris field
• Venting gas creating cloud around spacecraft
• Something is catastrophically wrong
• Oxygen pouring into space

On the instruments:
• Oxygen tank 2 pressure: ZERO
• Oxygen tank 1 pressure: FALLING
• Two fuel cells offline
• Main bus B voltage dropping
• Warning lights cascading

Lovell: "We are venting something out into space"

=== THE DAMAGE (Unknown at the time) ===
What actually happened:
• Oxygen tank #2 exploded in Service Module
• Entire 13-foot panel blown off spacecraft
• Damaged oxygen tank #1 (now leaking)
• Fuel cells failing (need oxygen to generate power)
• Service module crippled
• Main engine (SPS) unsafe to use

Crew won't see the damage until SM jettison (GET 138:02)

=== THE CRISIS UNFOLDS ===
Immediate problems:
• Losing oxygen rapidly (need it to breathe)
• Losing power (fuel cells dying)
• Losing main engine (can't thrust home directly)
• 200,000 miles from Earth
• Traveling AWAY from home at 24,000 mph
• Command Module will be dead in hours

Mission Control realizes:
• Moon landing: IMPOSSIBLE
• Normal return: IMPOSSIBLE
• Crew survival: UNCERTAIN

Gene Kranz (Flight Director):
"Okay, let's everybody keep cool. Let's solve the problem, but let's not make it any worse by guessing."

=== WHAT'S AT STAKE ===
The math is brutal:
• 3 astronauts
• 200,000 miles from Earth
• Crippled spacecraft
• Limited oxygen, power, water
• 4+ days to get home
• Margin for error: ZERO

This is now a survival mission.

NEXT DECISION: Turn Around or Free-Return?
INFO SLIDE #2
WHAT CAUSED THE EXPLOSION?
Oxygen Tank #2 — A Chain of Small Mistakes

=== THE SIMPLE ANSWER ===
Oxygen tank #2 in the Service Module exploded at GET 55:54:53

But WHY did it explode?
The real answer: Three mistakes over two years.

=== MISTAKE #1: THE DROP (1968) ===
During Manufacturing:

What Happened:
• Oxygen Tank #2 was dropped about 2 inches
• Happened during removal before it was installed in Apollo 13's Service Module
• This likely damaged its fill/drain line inside
• Workers inspected the outside: looked fine
• Internal damage NOT detected

The Problem:
• Fill/drain system probably bent or cracked
• Would cause trouble later during testing
• But no one knew yet

Result: Hidden damage went unnoticed

=== MISTAKE #2: THE DESIGN CHANGE (1965) ===
The Voltage Mismatch:

Original Design:
• All spacecraft systems ran on 28 volts
• Thermostatic switches designed for 28 volts
• Everything matched and worked safely

NASA's Change:
• Upgraded ground test equipment to 65 volts
• More powerful, better for testing
• MOST components upgraded to handle 65 volts
• BUT: Tiny thermostat switches NOT upgraded (still rated for 28V)

Why It Mattered:
• Higher voltage = more heat in switches
• Switches designed for 28V now carrying 65V
• If they got too hot, they could weld shut
• Then they couldn't turn off the heaters!

Result: Safety system compromised

=== MISTAKE #3: THE TESTING INCIDENT (March 1970) ===
Pre-Launch Ground Test (CDDT):

The Test:
• March 1970 - About one month before launch
• Fill oxygen tank for countdown test
• Time to drain tank after test is done
• Normal drain valve wouldn't work (damaged from drop?)

The "Solution":
• Workers couldn't drain tank normally
• So they used heaters and fans to boil off the oxygen
• Ran ground power at ~65 volts
• Left heaters running for about 8 HOURS to empty tank

What Actually Happened:
• Temperature inside tank reached ~1,000°F (540°C!)
• That's hot enough to melt aluminum
• But temperature gauge only read up to 85°F
• Workers saw 85°F and thought everything was fine
• Real temperature was 12× hotter than gauge could show!

The Damage:
• Thermostat switches welded shut from extreme heat
• Teflon wire insulation melted and burned off
• Bare electrical wires exposed inside tank
• Pure oxygen environment (extremely flammable)
• Bomb waiting to explode

Warning Signs Missed:
• Unusual readings during test
• But technicians didn't understand what they meant
• Tank passed pressure tests (pressure was fine)
• Exterior looked normal
• Cleared for flight

Result: Damaged tank loaded onto Apollo 13

=== THE EXPLOSION (April 13, 1970) ===
GET 55:54:53 — Routine Request, Catastrophic Result:

Mission Control's Request:
"We'd like you to stir up your cryo tanks."

Standard Procedure:
• Stir oxygen fans to get accurate readings
• Done many times on every mission
• Should take 10 seconds
• Completely routine

What Happened:
1. Jack Swigert flips switch to activate Tank #2 fans
2. Electricity flows through DAMAGED WIRING
3. Bare wires spark inside tank
4. Spark ignites in pure oxygen environment
5. Fire spreads instantly (oxygen makes everything burn)
6. Pressure builds rapidly
7. EXPLOSION rips through tank
8. Blast blows off entire 13-foot panel from Service Module
9. Damages Tank #1 (now leaking oxygen)
10. Fuel cells fail (need oxygen to make power)
11. Spacecraft crippled 200,000 miles from Earth

The Physics:
• Pure oxygen makes fire burn 10× hotter and faster
• 900+ psi pressure released like bomb
• Explosion visible through windows ("sparklies")
• Oxygen venting into space like jet
• Spacecraft tumbling from blast

=== THE TIMELINE ===
How Three Mistakes Combined:

1968: Tank dropped → Fill line damaged
1965: Voltage upgrade → Switches can't handle heat
March 1970: 8-hour heater test → Wiring burned
April 13, 1970: Routine stir → EXPLOSION

Any ONE mistake prevented = no explosion
All three mistakes together = disaster

=== THE DAMAGE ===
What the Explosion Destroyed:

Service Module:
❌ Oxygen Tank #2: Completely destroyed (exploded)
❌ Oxygen Tank #1: Damaged, leaking rapidly
❌ Fuel Cell 1: Offline (no oxygen to make power)
❌ Fuel Cell 2: Offline (no oxygen to make power)
❌ Fuel Cell 3: Offline (no oxygen to make power)
❌ Side panel: Entire 13-foot section blown off
❌ High-gain antenna: Damaged
⚠️ Main engine (SPS): Unknown damage, unsafe to use

Command Module:
⚠️ Running on batteries only (fuel cells dead)
⚠️ Oxygen leaking from damaged Service Module
⚠️ Must power down to save batteries
⚠️ Temperature will drop to freezing

Lunar Module "Aquarius":
✅ Completely undamaged (separate from explosion)
✅ Own oxygen supply (independent tanks)
✅ Own power (separate batteries)
✅ Becomes the lifeboat that saves three lives

=== WHY THIS MATTERS ===
Lessons About Safety:

Small Problems Can Become Big:
• 2-inch drop seemed minor
• Voltage mismatch seemed unimportant
• 8-hour test seemed normal
• Together: nearly killed three men

Check Everything Carefully:
• Inspect inside, not just outside
• Match voltage ratings exactly
• Watch for unusual readings
• Don't assume "looks fine" means "is fine"

Multiple Backups Save Lives:
• Tank #1 damaged but LM had oxygen
• Fuel cells failed but LM had batteries
• Main engine unsafe but LM engine worked
• Redundancy meant survival

=== WHAT NASA CHANGED ===
After Apollo 13:

Oxygen Tank Redesign:
✅ Added third oxygen tank (more redundancy)
✅ Put third tank in different location (separate from #1 and #2)
✅ Upgraded all thermostatic switches to proper voltage
✅ Better wire insulation (won't burn in oxygen)
✅ Redesigned heaters (safer, can't overheat)
✅ Temperature gauges read full range (no hidden overheating)

Testing Improvements:
✅ Never use heaters to drain tanks (new drain procedures)
✅ X-ray inspect all pressure vessels
✅ Document every unusual reading (investigate fully)
✅ Double-check voltage ratings on ALL components
✅ Temperature monitoring during all tests

Inspection Rules:
✅ Report all drops, no matter how small
✅ Full internal inspection after any damage
✅ Don't launch if anything seems unusual
✅ "When in doubt, check it out"

Every Apollo Mission After:
• Used redesigned oxygen tanks
• Safer testing procedures
• More careful inspections
• Zero oxygen tank failures

=== DID YOU KNOW? ===
Strange Facts:

• The explosion happened at 13:13 military time (Houston)
• Mission number: Apollo 13
• Launch date: 4/11/70 (add digits: 4+1+1 = 6, plus 7+0 = 7... both unlucky?)
• Superstitious? Maybe just coincidence.

• The actual cause wasn't discovered until months after landing
• Investigation took 3,000+ hours of testing
• Engineers recreated the damage in lab
• Found melted Teflon inside test tanks

• Tank #2 was originally built for Apollo 10
• Moved to Apollo 13 after modifications
• If it had stayed on Apollo 10, might have exploded there instead
• Apollo 10 crew: Very lucky

=== THE LESSON ===
Not Bad Luck. Bad Wiring.

Three mistakes:
1. DROP (damaged fill line)
2. VOLTAGE (switches couldn't handle it)
3. TEST (8 hours of hidden overheating)

One explosion.
Three men survived.
Countless lessons learned.

Don't blame superstition.
Blame damage no one caught.

And remember:
Small mistakes add up.
Check everything twice.
Safety always matters.

💥 Three Mistakes → One Explosion → Zero Deaths

CAUSE IDENTIFIED. CREW SAVED. NEVER REPEATED.

• 32 inches diameter
• Crew crawls through in zero gravity
• Sealed with hatch on each end

Apollo 13 Configuration:
• CM "Odyssey" + SM (damaged) + LM "Aquarius"
• All three modules connected
• Crew used tunnel to move between CM and LM
• LM became primary habitat
• CM powered down but still attached
• SM provided structural support (until jettison)

=== JETTISON SEQUENCE (RE-ENTRY) ===
Step 1 - Service Module Jettison (GET 138:02):
• SM separated from CM
• Drifts away into space
• First view of massive damage
• CM now exposed

Step 2 - Lunar Module Jettison (GET 141:30):
• Tunnel sealed
• LM separated from CM
• "Farewell, Aquarius, and we thank you"
• CM alone for re-entry

Step 3 - Re-Entry (GET 142:40:46):
• CM only module with heat shield
• Parachutes deploy from CM
• CM lands in ocean
• SM and LM burn up in atmosphere (eventually)

=== SYSTEMS COMPARISON ===

| Volume        | ~210 cu ft   | N/A          | ~160 cu ft   |
| Power         | Batteries    | Fuel cells   | Batteries    |
| Main Engine   | Small RCS    | SPS (big!)   | DPS + APS    |
| Life Support  | Shared w/SM  | Provides O2  | Independent  |
| Re-entry      | YES ✅       | NO (burns)   | NO (burns)   |

=== WHY THREE MODULES? ===
Specialization:
• CM: Optimized for re-entry (heat shield, aerodynamics)
• SM: Power and propulsion workhorse (fuel cells, main engine)
• LM: Moon landing specialist (lightweight, landing legs)

Weight Savings:
• Don't carry landing legs to Earth
• Don't carry heavy SM through atmosphere
• Shed weight at each stage

Redundancy:
• LM has independent systems (backup!)
• Separate power sources
• Multiple oxygen supplies
• This redundancy saved Apollo 13

=== THE LESSON ===
Three modules, three purposes.
One explosion, one lifeboat.

The LM wasn't supposed to save lives in space.
It was supposed to land on the Moon.

But when Odyssey failed, Aquarius stepped up.

A spacecraft designed for 2 for 2 days
Kept 3 men alive for 4+ days.

Engineering redundancy saved three lives.

🚀 CM + SM + LM = HOME 🏠
NARRATIVE SLIDE #3
LIFEBOAT & MOON FLYBY
April 13-14, 1970 | Aquarius Becomes Home

=== AFTER THE EXPLOSION ===
GET ~56:00:00 - The Decision
• Command Module "Odyssey" dying—oxygen nearly gone
• Must power down CM to save batteries for re-entry
• Only option: Lunar Module "Aquarius" as lifeboat
• Problem: LM designed for 2 people for 2 days
• Reality: Must support 3 people for 4+ days

=== MOVING TO THE LM ===
Crew squeezes into "Aquarius"
• Cramped: ~160 cubic feet (like a walk-in closet)
• Designed for standing room, not living quarters
• Three grown men in space suits
• Moving one arm disturbs the other two
• No privacy, no comfort, no sleep

Lovell: "Aquarius, this is Houston. You are GO for undocking."
But they're NOT undocking—they're living in it!

=== THE LIFEBOAT ===
What Aquarius provides:
✅ Oxygen reserves (enough for 3... barely)
✅ Battery power (conserve every amp)
✅ Descent engine (for course corrections)
✅ Life support systems (running overtime)

What it doesn't provide:
❌ Warmth (temperature drops to 38°F)
❌ Space (extremely cramped)
❌ Comfort (condensation on walls, no sleep)
❌ Certainty (designed for 2 for 2, not 3 for 4)

=== SWINGING AROUND THE MOON ===
GET 61:29:42 - Free-Return Trajectory Burn
• DPS burn (~31 seconds) using LM descent engine
• Put spacecraft back on free-return path
• Will loop behind Moon and head home
• Safer than trying to turn around
• Must wait... but they'll get home

Day 4 - April 14, 1970
Closest Approach to Moon: ~137 nautical miles (~158 miles / ~254 km)

Through the LM window:
• Lunar surface rushing below
• Pericynthion (closest point to Moon)
• Should have been landing at Fra Mauro right now
• Instead, just passing by for survival

Communication Blackout:
• Spacecraft passes behind Moon
• No radio contact with Earth
• Minutes of silence
• Families hold their breath
• Signal returns—they're alive!

=== THE PC+2 BURN ===
GET 79:27:40 - Speed Up Burn
• Major burn 2 hours after pericynthion
• LM descent engine fires for 4½-5 minutes
• Adds ~900 ft/s velocity
• Shortens trip by ~9-10 hours
• Targets Pacific recovery zone near USS Iwo Jima

Crew hears the engine:
• Longest burn yet in damaged spacecraft
• Engine performs flawlessly
• Trajectory set for Pacific Ocean
• Now it's a race against time

=== SURVIVAL CONDITIONS ===
Temperature: 38-50°F (freezing)
• Water condensation on every surface
• Ice forming on equipment
• Crew shivering constantly
• Can see their breath

Water Rations: 6 oz per person per day
• Normal: 64 oz (8 cups)
• Now: Less than 1 cup total
• Severe dehydration setting in
• Haise developing kidney infection

Power Conservation:
• Minimal heaters (too cold to sleep)
• Minimal lights (stumbling in dark)
• Minimal communications (families terrified)
• Every amp-hour counts for re-entry

Sleep Deprivation:
• Impossible to sleep in cramped, freezing LM
• Constant stress and worry
• Moving disturbs others
• Exhaustion building

=== THE LONG WAIT BEGINS ===
Current position: Behind Moon, heading home
Time to Earth: ~3.5 days
Status: Alive but suffering
Challenges ahead:
• CO2 levels rising
• Water running out
• Batteries draining
• Temperature dropping
• Crew weakening

But Aquarius is keeping them alive.

NEXT: The Long Cold Journey Home
DECISION POINT #3
STARS OR SUN/EARTH NAVIGATION?
GET ~79:27:38 | Lost in Space

=== THE SITUATION ===
▸ Need to align spacecraft navigation platform for accurate course corrections
▸ Normal method: sight on known stars using alignment telescope (AOT)
▸ Problem: Explosion created debris field—"sparklies" everywhere
▸ Through telescope, debris looks identical to stars
▸ Impossible to determine which points of light are real stars
▸ Without proper alignment, can't aim precisely for Earth

=== OPTION 1: STAR SIGHTING ===
Subtitle: Use alignment telescope to sight on stars

PROS:
• Most accurate navigation method available
• Standard Apollo procedure (proven technique)
• Provides precise platform orientation
• Computer can calculate exact trajectory

CONS:
• Debris field makes stars invisible
• Cannot distinguish sparklies from real stars
• Multiple false sightings likely
• Could misalign platform completely
• Time-consuming trial and error

=== OPTION 2: SUN/EARTH TERMINATOR ===
Subtitle: Manually align using Sun in AOT + Earth edge in COAS

PROS:
• Sun is unmistakable (brightest object)
• Earth terminator (day/night line) clearly visible
• No confusion with debris
• Faster than searching for stars
• "Good enough" accuracy for course corrections

CONS:
• Less precise than star alignment
• Manual alignment is tricky
• Requires simultaneous viewing through two instruments
• Small errors could compound over distance
• Not the "approved" NASA procedure

=== DECISION PROMPT ===
🤔 WHAT SHOULD THE CREW DO?

=== HISTORICAL DECISION ===
NASA chose SUN/EARTH TERMINATOR method
• GET ~79:27:38 - Manual alignment procedure
• Sun positioned in AOT (Alignment Optical Telescope)
• Earth terminator (day/night line) centered in COAS (Crew Optical Alignment Sight)
• Jim Lovell performed delicate manual alignment
• "Good enough" accuracy achieved for safe trajectory
• Proved that improvisation and manual skill beat perfect equipment
INFO SLIDE #4
NAVIGATION METHODS
How to Find Your Way Home in Space

=== THE CHALLENGE ===
In Space:
• No GPS satellites
• No road signs
• No landmarks
• No "up" or "down"
• 240,000+ miles from Earth
• Traveling 20,000+ mph
• Must aim for target smaller than a dime at 100 feet

The Question: How do you know where you are and where you're going?

=== METHOD #1: STAR SIGHTING (NORMAL PROCEDURE) ===
The Principle: Stars Are Fixed Reference Points

The Alignment Optical Telescope (AOT):
• Built into Lunar Module
• High-precision telescope
• Sights on specific known stars
• Computer calculates spacecraft orientation

Standard Procedure:
1. Astronaut looks through telescope
2. Identifies two specific stars (from catalog)
3. Centers each star in crosshairs
4. Computer calculates platform alignment
5. Knows exactly which way spacecraft is pointing

Why It Works:
• Stars are SO FAR away they appear fixed
• Star positions known with extreme precision
• Same stars visible from anywhere in solar system
• Like using North Star for navigation on Earth

Accuracy: Extremely high (~0.5 degrees)

The Apollo 13 Problem:
❌ Debris field from explosion created "sparklies"
❌ Ice crystals and metal fragments glitter like stars
❌ Impossible to tell which points of light are real stars
❌ Could misalign platform completely
❌ Standard procedure UNUSABLE

=== METHOD #2: SUN/EARTH TERMINATOR (EMERGENCY BACKUP) ===
The Apollo 13 Solution:

What They Used:
1. The Sun (viewed in AOT - Alignment Optical Telescope)
2. Earth's terminator (viewed in COAS - Crew Optical Alignment Sight)

Why It Worked:
• Sun is UNMISTAKABLE (brightest object, can't confuse it)
• Earth's terminator (day/night line) clearly visible
• Two large targets instead of tiny stars
• No confusion with debris

The Terminator:
• Line between day and night on Earth
• Clearly visible from space
• Sharp contrast between light/dark
• Acts as reference line for orientation

The Procedure (GET ~73:46):
1. Position Sun in center of AOT reticle
2. Simultaneously position Earth's terminator in COAS
3. Use both instruments at same time
4. Cross-reference to determine orientation
5. "Good enough" for course corrections

Crew Optical Alignment Sight (COAS):
• Simple telescope mounted in window
• Crosshairs for precise aiming
• Hand-held or mounted
• Used for docking, now for navigation

Accuracy: Lower than stars (~2-3 degrees) but GOOD ENOUGH

Jim Lovell's Skill:
• Years of experience
• Steady hands in zero gravity
• Manual alignment under pressure
• Perfect execution

Result: PC+2 burn successful, trajectory on target

=== METHOD #3: INERTIAL MEASUREMENT UNIT (IMU) ===
The Platform:

What It Is:
• Gyroscope-based platform
• "Remembers" spacecraft orientation
• Updated by star sightings or manual alignment
• Provides continuous attitude reference

How Gyroscopes Work:
• Spinning mass resists changes to orientation
• Three gyros for X, Y, Z axes
• Acts as stable platform in space
• Like inner ear for balance on Earth

The Problem:
• Gyros drift over time (loses accuracy)
• Must be re-aligned periodically
• Normally use star sightings
• Apollo 13 used Sun/Earth instead

Platform Alignment:
• "Tells" IMU which way is which
• IMU then tracks all movements
• Computer uses IMU data for navigation
• Critical for automatic guidance

=== METHOD #4: GROUND TRACKING ===
Mission Control's View:

Tracking Stations:
• Radio antennas around the world
• Measure radio signals from spacecraft
• Calculate distance and velocity
• Doppler shift shows speed toward/away

The Math:
• Measure signal strength (distance)
• Measure frequency shift (velocity)
• Calculate position from multiple stations
• Predict trajectory

Ground-Based Navigation:
• Mission Control tracks spacecraft
• Radios up course corrections
• Backup to onboard systems
• Very accurate but delayed

Apollo 13 Use:
✅ Mission Control tracked continuously
✅ Calculated trajectory corrections
✅ Radioed instructions to crew
✅ Double-checked crew's manual alignments

=== METHOD #5: VISUAL LANDMARKS ===
Earth and Moon as References:

Earth:
• Visible from 240,000 miles away
• Terminator (day/night line) clear
• Can estimate direction and distance
• Not precise but useful

Moon:
• Visible during approach and departure
• Craters can be identified
• Used during lunar orbit
• Apollo 13 saw it during flyby

Spacecraft Attitude:
• "Barbecue roll" - slow rotation for thermal control
• Keeps one side from overheating
• Crew can see Earth/Moon through windows
• Helps maintain situational awareness

=== THE INSTRUMENTS ===
AOT - Alignment Optical Telescope (LM):
• Location: Built into LM roof
• Purpose: Sight on stars for navigation
• Magnification: 6x or 60x
• Apollo 13: Used for Sun alignment

COAS - Crew Optical Alignment Sight:
• Location: LM window mount
• Purpose: Docking alignment, now navigation
• Features: Crosshairs, hand-held or mounted
• Apollo 13: Used for Earth terminator

Sextant (CM):
• Location: Command Module telescope
• Purpose: Star sightings, angle measurements
• Not used on Apollo 13 (CM powered down)

=== NAVIGATION CHALLENGES ON APOLLO 13 ===
The Problems:
❌ Can't use stars (debris field)
❌ Can't use CM sextant (powered down)
❌ Must use backup methods
❌ Manual alignment less accurate
❌ Every course correction critical

The Solutions:
✅ Sun/Earth terminator alignment
✅ Ground tracking from Mission Control
✅ Jim Lovell's skill and experience
✅ IMU maintained between alignments
✅ Multiple mid-course corrections

The Burns:
1. GET 61:29:42 - Free-return DPS burn (~31 sec)
2. GET 79:27:40 - PC+2 burn (4½ min, ~900 ft/s)
3. GET ~105:18 - Manual mid-course tweak (~7-8 ft/s)

All successful with manual navigation!

=== COURSE CORRECTION PROCESS ===
Step-by-Step:

1. Alignment:
   • Position Sun in AOT
   • Position Earth terminator in COAS
   • Tell computer current orientation

2. Calculation:
   • Computer calculates required burn
   • Duration, direction, engine power
   • Ground Control double-checks

3. Orientation:
   • Point spacecraft in correct direction
   • Use hand controller to aim
   • Verify alignment visually

4. Burn:
   • Fire descent engine (DPS)
   • Monitor duration precisely
   • Shut down at exact moment

5. Verification:
   • Check new trajectory
   • Mission Control confirms
   • Make small corrections if needed

=== THE MATH OF SPACE NAVIGATION ===
Orbital Mechanics:

Free-Return Trajectory:
• Uses Moon's gravity to slingshot back
• No engine needed to change direction
• Predictable physics
• Safe backup plan

Delta-V (Δv):
• Change in velocity needed
• Measured in feet per second (ft/s)
• PC+2 burn: ~900 ft/s
• Mid-course: ~7-8 ft/s

Precision Required:
• Re-entry corridor: ~2° margin
• Target: -6.2° to -6.5° angle
• Error: Skip off or burn up
• Manual navigation hit the target!

=== DID YOU KNOW? ===
Navigation Facts:

• Apollo computer: 64 kilobytes of memory
• Modern smartphone: 1,000,000x more memory
• Yet Apollo 13 made it home with manual alignment

• Jim Lovell logged more space time than any astronaut before Apollo 13
• His experience was critical for manual navigation

• The Sun/Earth terminator method became backup procedure for future missions
• Added to NASA emergency playbook

=== THE LESSON ===
When the perfect system fails,
Improvise with what you have.

When stars are invisible,
Use the Sun.

When computers aren't enough,
Trust human skill.

When everything goes wrong,
Work the problem.

Navigation saved Apollo 13.

DECISION POINT #4
BUILD THE CO2 MAILBOX?
GET ~90:00:00 | Rising Carbon Dioxide Crisis

=== THE SITUATION ===
▸ CO2 levels rising dangerously in the LM (approaching ~15 mmHg—deadly)
▸ LM's lithium hydroxide (LiOH) canisters are ROUND, sized for 2 people for 2 days
▸ Now supporting 3 people for ~4 days—LM scrubbers running out of capacity
▸ Command Module has extra SQUARE LiOH canisters (unused)
▸ Problem: Square canisters won't fit in round LM receptacles
▸ Available materials: plastic bags, cardboard, duct tape, hoses, flight manual covers

=== OPTION 1: DO NOTHING BUT REST ===
Subtitle: Reduce physical activity to slow CO2 production

PROS:
• Uses existing systems—no construction needed
• No risk of adapter failure
• Conserves energy for crew
• Simple approach

CONS:
• Not enough—CO2 will still keep rising to deadly levels
• High CO2 impairs judgment and decision-making
• Could lose consciousness before realizing danger
• Death by CO2 poisoning within hours
• No backup plan if this fails

=== OPTION 2: BUILD "MAILBOX" ADAPTER ===
Subtitle: Create square-to-round adapter using onboard materials

PROS:
• Uses CM's fresh square lithium hydroxide canisters
• Can sustain 3 people for entire journey
• Only solution that actually removes CO2
• Materials are available on board

CONS:
• Never attempted before—completely improvised
• Uncertain if materials will seal properly
• Duct tape and plastic might not hold vacuum
• Failure means death—no second chance
• Requires precision assembly in zero-g

=== DECISION PROMPT ===
🤔 WHAT SHOULD THE CREW DO?

=== HISTORICAL DECISION ===
NASA chose BUILD THE MAILBOX
• Mission Control engineers designed solution using only materials aboard
• Crew built adapter using:
  - Square CM lithium hydroxide canisters
  - Plastic bags
  - Cardboard from flight manual covers
  - Duct tape (lots of it!)
  - Hoses
• CO2 dropped from ~14.9 mmHg to ~4.6 mmHg—back to safe levels
• Lifesaving ingenuity—solution saved crew's lives
• Proved that "duct tape fixes everything," even in space
INFO SLIDE #5
THE MAILBOX
Duct Tape, Cardboard, and Genius

=== THE CO2 CRISIS ===
The Problem:

Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Levels Rising:
• Humans exhale CO2 with every breath
• In sealed spacecraft, CO2 accumulates
• High CO2 = headaches, nausea, unconsciousness, death
• Deadly level: ~15 mmHg partial pressure
• Apollo 13 approaching ~15 mmHg

The Numbers:
• LM designed for: 2 people for 45 hours
• Apollo 13 reality: 3 people for 87+ hours
• That's 2.9x the CO2 production!

Symptoms of High CO2:
• Headaches
• Dizziness
• Difficulty breathing
• Impaired judgment
• Unconsciousness
• Death

Time to Crisis: Hours, not days

=== THE SCRUBBER MISMATCH ===
How CO2 Scrubbers Work:

Lithium Hydroxide (LiOH) Canisters:
• Chemical that absorbs CO2 from air
• Air blown through canister
• CO2 chemically binds to LiOH
• Clean air comes out
• Eventually saturates (must replace)

The Shape Problem:
• LM canisters: ROUND (cylindrical)
• CM canisters: SQUARE (rectangular)
• Different sizes, different connections
• NOT interchangeable by design

The Inventory:
• LM has: Limited round canisters (running out)
• CM has: Plenty of fresh square canisters (unused)
• Problem: Square peg won't fit in round hole

The Cruel Irony:
• Plenty of fresh scrubbers on board
• Just can't use them
• Like having food you can't open
• Crew could suffocate with solution 10 feet away

=== THE MISSION CONTROL SCRAMBLE ===
GET ~90:00:00 - Engineers Attack the Problem

The Challenge to Engineers:
"We've got to find a way to make THIS..."
[holds up square CM canister]
"...fit into the hole for THIS..."
[holds up round LM canister]
"...using nothing but THAT."
[dumps out materials available on spacecraft]

Available Materials on Apollo 13:
✅ Plastic bags (food storage)
✅ Cardboard (from flight manual covers)
✅ Duct tape (gray tape, lots of it)
✅ Hoses (from LM systems)
✅ Suit hoses (from spacesuits)
✅ Towels
✅ Bungee cords

NOT Available:
❌ Special tools
❌ Glue or sealants
❌ 3D printer
❌ Machine shop
❌ Hardware store

The Engineering Team:
• Work around the clock
• Build prototype on ground using EXACT same materials
• Test for air leaks
• Design step-by-step instructions
• Must work in zero gravity
• Must work first time - no second chance

=== THE MAILBOX DESIGN ===
The Concept: Force Air Through Square Canister

Components:
1. Square CM lithium hydroxide canister (the filter)
2. Plastic bag (sealed chamber around canister)
3. Cardboard (structural support and air ducting)
4. Duct tape (seals everything together)
5. Hose (connects to LM air circulation system)

How It Works:
1. Seal square canister inside plastic bag
2. Cut hole in plastic bag for air inlet
3. Attach hose to bag for air outlet
4. Use cardboard to create air duct
5. Tape everything together (LOTS of tape)
6. Connect to LM's air circulation fan
7. Fan pulls air through makeshift scrubber
8. Clean air returns to cabin

Why "Mailbox"?
• Shape looked like rural mailbox
• Square opening with connection on side
• Nickname stuck

=== THE BUILD PROCEDURE ===
Mission Control Radioed Instructions:

Step 1: Gather Materials
"Okay, we need you to find the following items..."
• 2 square LiOH canisters from CM stowage
• Large plastic bag
• Flight manual cover (cardboard)
• Duct tape roll
• Suit hose

Step 2: Prepare the Canister
• Place square canister in plastic bag
• Position canister for air flow
• Ensure proper orientation

Step 3: Create Air Path
• Cut hole in plastic bag
• Insert hose into hole
• Seal around hose with tape

Step 4: Cardboard Support
• Cut cardboard from manual cover
• Create duct for air flow
• Tape to bag structure

Step 5: Seal Everything
• Duct tape around all seams
• Check for air leaks
• Reinforce connections
• Use MORE tape (can't have too much!)

Step 6: Connect to LM System
• Attach hose to LM air circulation
• Position mailbox securely
• Turn on circulation fan

Step 7: Monitor CO2 Levels
• Watch gauges anxiously
• Wait for CO2 to drop
• Pray it works

Build Time: ~1 hour of careful assembly

=== THE RESULT ===
Moment of Truth:

CO2 Level Before Mailbox: ~14.9 mmHg (near-deadly)
CO2 Level After Mailbox: ~4.6 mmHg (safe!)

Drop: 10.3 mmHg in minutes
Time to Safe Levels: Less than 1 hour
Success Rate: 100%

The Crew's Reaction:
• Relief and amazement
• Headaches clearing
• Breathing easier
• Crisis averted

Jim Lovell: "We have a mailbox!"

=== THE MATERIALS BREAKDOWN ===
What Each Component Did:

Plastic Bag:
• Created sealed chamber
• Forced air through canister
• Prevented leaks to space

Cardboard:
• Structural support
• Directed air flow
• Lightweight and available

Duct Tape:
• Sealed all connections
• Held assembly together
• Airtight seal
• The real hero of Apollo 13

Hose:
• Connected mailbox to LM fan
• Carried clean air back to cabin
• Flexible for positioning

Square Canister:
• Fresh lithium hydroxide
• Absorbed CO2 from air
• Plenty available in CM

=== WHY IT WORKED ===
Engineering Principles:

Pressure Differential:
• LM fan creates suction
• Pulls air through mailbox
• Forces air through LiOH canister
• Returns clean air to cabin

Seal Integrity:
• Duct tape creates airtight seal
• Plastic bag contains air flow
• No leaks to space (vacuum outside)

Chemical Process:
• LiOH + CO2 → Lithium Carbonate
• Chemical reaction absorbs CO2
• Process works regardless of canister shape
• Just need air to flow through

Human Ingenuity:
• Problem-solving under pressure
• Using what's available
• Testing before execution
• Clear communication Earth ↔ Space

=== THE LEGACY ===
What the Mailbox Represented:

🧠 Intelligence:
• Engineers solved impossible problem
• Used only materials on board
• Designed in hours, not months

🤝 Teamwork:
• Mission Control designed
• Crew built
• Perfect coordination
• Trust between Earth and space

🛠️ Ingenuity:
• No fancy equipment needed
• Duct tape and cardboard
• Sometimes simple is best
• "Work with what you have"

⏱️ Speed:
• CO2 rising fast
• Designed solution in hours
• Built in ~1 hour
• Worked immediately

=== DUCT TAPE IN SPACE ===
The Universal Fix:

Why Duct Tape Works in Space:
✅ Adhesive works in vacuum
✅ Strong and flexible
✅ Airtight seal
✅ Easy to use in zero gravity
✅ Doesn't outgas (release chemicals)

Apollo 13 Duct Tape Uses:
• Sealed mailbox adapter
• Repaired other systems
• Held equipment in place
• Temporary fixes everywhere

Every Mission After:
• Extra duct tape added to manifest
• "If duct tape can't fix it, nothing can"

=== DID YOU KNOW? ===
Mailbox Facts:

• Original ground prototype is in Smithsonian museum
• Actual flight mailbox burned up during re-entry (in LM)
• Procedure added to all future Apollo missions
• Inspired MacGyver TV show decades later

• CO2 stayed at safe levels for entire journey home
• Second mailbox built as backup (never needed)

• The square/round mismatch was known before flight
• But nobody thought LM would be lifeboat for 4 days
• Design assumption: LM used for 45 hours max

=== THE LESSON ===
When perfect solutions aren't available,
Improvise with what you have.

When fancy equipment fails,
Use duct tape and cardboard.

When time is running out,
Stay calm and work the problem.

When CO2 is killing you,
Build a mailbox.

DECISION POINT #5
WATER CONSERVATION STRATEGY
GET ~85:00:00 | Critical Water Shortage

=== THE SITUATION ===
▸ Water supplies critically low
▸ Water needed for three vital purposes:
  1. Drinking water for crew (survival)
  2. Cooling systems for electronics (prevents overheating/fire)
  3. Humidification for breathing (prevents lung damage)
▸ Current consumption rate: will run dry 18 hours before splashdown
▸ Must drastically reduce usage or risk death/equipment failure

=== OPTION 1: EQUAL RATIONING ===
Subtitle: Distribute water evenly across all three systems

PROS:
• Balanced approach—no single system completely fails
• Maintains all systems partially functional
• Democratic distribution of scarce resource
• Reduces guilt over prioritization decisions

CONS:
• All three systems degraded simultaneously
• Moderate crew dehydration affects judgment
• Moderate equipment risk of overheating
• Moderate breathing discomfort
• May not save enough—could lose everything

=== OPTION 2: PRIORITIZE DRINKING WATER ===
Subtitle: Give crew adequate water, minimize cooling/humidification

PROS:
• Crew stays hydrated and alert for critical decisions
• Sharp minds for re-entry procedures
• Humans can survive dry air temporarily
• Crew comfort maximized

CONS:
• Electronics risk overheating and failure
• Air becomes painfully dry
• Potential equipment fires
• Could lose navigation/guidance systems
• Breathing discomfort causes fatigue

=== OPTION 3: PRIORITIZE EQUIPMENT COOLING ===
Subtitle: Keep electronics safe, minimize drinking water

PROS:
• Prevents electrical fires
• Maintains navigation and guidance systems
• Ensures re-entry computer functionality
• Equipment reliability maximized

CONS:
• Severe crew dehydration (dangerous)
• Impaired judgment and decision-making
• Physical weakness for re-entry procedures
• Crew might not survive to use equipment
• Medical complications from dehydration

=== DECISION PROMPT ===
🤔 WHAT SHOULD THE CREW DO?

=== HISTORICAL DECISION ===
NASA chose EXTREME RATIONING—prioritize survival
• Reduced to 6 ounces of water per person per day (normal: 64 oz)
• That's less than 1 cup per day!
• Minimal equipment cooling—accepted risk of overheating
• Minimal humidification—crew endured dry, painful breathing
• Combined crew weight loss: 31.5 pounds
• Haise developed kidney infection from dehydration
• Systems held together just long enough to get home

SURVIVAL CONDITIONS
Four Days in a Freezing, Cramped Lifeboat

=== THE LUNAR MODULE AS LIFEBOAT ===
Designed For: 2 astronauts, 45 hours (Moon landing mission)
Apollo 13 Reality: 3 astronauts, 87+ hours (4 days in space)

That's 2.9x the intended use!

=== TEMPERATURE: THE FREEZING CHALLENGE ===
The Cold Reality:

Inside Aquarius:
• Temperature: 38°F (3°C) minimum
• Some areas: 50°F
• Colder than a refrigerator
• Below freezing in some spots

Why So Cold?
• Power conservation = minimal heaters
• Electronics powered down to save batteries
• Service Module damaged (no heat from there)
• Space is -455°F (-270°C) all around
• Only thin aluminum walls for insulation

What the Crew Experienced:
❄️ Shivering constantly (can't get warm)
❄️ Numb fingers and toes
❄️ Difficulty sleeping (too cold)
❄️ Water condensation on every surface
❄️ Ice forming on windows and equipment
❄️ Can see breath in cabin air
❄️ Frostbite risk on extremities

Condensation Problem:
• Crew breathing creates moisture
• Cold walls cause condensation
• Water droplets float in zero gravity
• Equipment could short-circuit
• Constant worry about electrical systems

Medical Impact:
• Hypothermia risk
• Slowed reactions and thinking
• Reduced immune system function
• Fred Haise's kidney infection worsened by cold

No Warm Clothing:
• Only thin flight suits
• No space for heavy jackets
• Spacesuits too bulky to wear constantly
• Just had to endure the cold

=== WATER: SEVERE RATIONING ===
The Water Crisis:

Normal Consumption: 64 oz per person per day (8 cups)
Apollo 13 Ration: 6 oz per person per day (3/4 cup)

That's 1/10th of normal water intake!

Water Uses on Spacecraft:
1. Drinking (crew survival)
2. Cooling electronics (prevents overheating/fires)
3. Humidifying air (prevents lung damage from dry air)

The Rationing Decision:
• Prioritize crew survival (minimal drinking water)
• Minimal electronics cooling (accept risk)
• Minimal humidification (painful but survivable)

What 6 Ounces Looks Like:
• Less than 1 cup total per day
• 2-3 small sips every few hours
• Barely enough to swallow food
• Severe dehydration guaranteed

Effects of Dehydration:
🥵 Extreme thirst (dry mouth, cracked lips)
🥵 Dizziness and lightheadedness
🥵 Impaired judgment and confusion
🥵 Physical weakness
🥵 Kidney stress (Fred Haise's infection)
🥵 Dark urine (concentrated)
🥵 Headaches

Medical Consequences:
• Combined weight loss: 31.5 pounds total
  - Jim Lovell: 14 lbs
  - Jack Swigert: 5 lbs
  - Fred Haise: 6 lbs (+ kidney infection)
• Dehydration weakened crew for re-entry
• Recovery took weeks after splashdown

The Psychological Torture:
• Water available in CM (powered down, can't access)
• LM water limited (must last entire trip)
• Every drop counted
• Watching each other's consumption

=== POWER: EVERY AMP MATTERS ===
The Battery Crisis:

LM Battery Capacity:
• Designed for 45-hour lunar mission
• Now supporting 87+ hours (double!)
• Used for life support, navigation, communications

Power Budget:
• Calculated down to individual amps
• Every system evaluated: essential or not?
• Continuous monitoring of remaining power
• 20% remaining at splashdown (cutting it close!)

What Was Powered Down:
❌ Heaters (except critical components)
❌ Most cabin lights
❌ Non-essential electronics
❌ Communications (reduced to minimum)
❌ Guidance computer (except during burns)

What Stayed On:
✅ Life support (oxygen circulation)
✅ Minimal lighting (stumbling in dark)
✅ CO2 scrubbers (critical)
✅ Attitude control (spacecraft orientation)
✅ Communications (essential updates only)

The Communication Dilemma:
• Each radio transmission drains batteries
• Families desperate for updates
• Crew feels isolated
• Some silence periods: 6+ hours
• Mission Control flying blind

Radio Discipline:
• Essential updates only
• No casual conversation
• Families terrified during long silences
• Crew felt abandoned but understood

Battery Jump-Start (GET ~138:00:00):
• Transfer power from LM to CM
• Never tested before
• Risk of short-circuit
• Worked perfectly!
• Charged CM batteries for re-entry

=== FOOD: MINIMAL NUTRITION ===
The Food Problem:

Available Food:
• Freeze-dried packets
• Required water to prepare (don't have water!)
• Some "wet pack" foods available
• Limited variety

Consumption Reality:
• Hard to eat in extreme cold
• Dry food hard to swallow without water
• Stress kills appetite
• Forcing down calories

Nutrition Impact:
• Calorie deficit (burning more than eating)
• Weight loss from dehydration + malnutrition
• Weakened for re-entry tasks
• Mental fog from hunger + cold + stress

=== SLEEP: NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE ===
The Sleep Deprivation Crisis:

Why Sleep Was Impossible:
😴 Temperature too cold to relax
😴 Cramped quarters (moving wakes others)
😴 Constant stress and worry
😴 Uncomfortable in zero gravity
😴 Noise from systems and alarms
😴 Bright sunlight through windows
😴 No day/night cycle in space

Sleep Attempts:
• Brief naps (minutes, not hours)
• Never deep sleep
• Constantly startled awake
• Exhaustion building

Effects of Sleep Deprivation:
• Impaired judgment
• Slowed reactions
• Irritability
• Difficulty concentrating
• Mistakes more likely
• Dangerous during critical re-entry

Jim Lovell's Experience:
• Fourth spaceflight (used to discomfort)
• But worst conditions ever
• Pushed through on experience
• Leadership required alertness

Rookies Swigert & Haise:
• First spaceflight
• Expected Moon landing adventure
• Got survival nightmare instead
• Performed admirably under stress

=== OXYGEN: THE ONE BRIGHT SPOT ===
Oxygen Status:

LM Oxygen Supply:
✅ Sufficient for 3 people for journey
✅ CO2 scrubbers working (thanks to mailbox)
✅ Breathing not a problem (after mailbox fix)

Oxygen Storage:
• Stored in LM descent stage tanks
• Separate from damaged SM tanks
• Enough capacity for extended mission

The Relief:
• At least they could breathe
• CO2 controlled at ~4.6 mmHg (safe)
• One less thing to worry about

=== SPACE: CRAMPED QUARTERS ===
The Physical Constraints:

Lunar Module Interior:
• ~160 cubic feet (like walk-in closet)
• Designed for 2 standing astronauts
• Now holding 3 people
• NO SEATS (standing room only)

The Reality:
• Can't stretch out
• Bumping into each other constantly
• Moving disturbs everyone
• No privacy whatsoever
• Personal space: zero

Zero Gravity "Helps":
• Can float in any orientation
• Not standing on feet for days
• But still cramped
• Equipment everywhere

=== WASTE MANAGEMENT ===
The Uncomfortable Reality:

Bathroom Facilities:
• Urine collection bags
• Fecal collection bags
• No privacy
• Difficult in zero gravity

With Dehydration:
• Less urine (darker, concentrated)
• Uncomfortable but less frequent
• Fred Haise's kidney infection made it painful

The Psychological Toll:
• No privacy for 4+ days
• Three men in tiny space
• Personal hygiene impossible
• Just had to endure

=== CUMULATIVE EFFECTS ===
The Total Stress on Crew:

Physical:
❄️ Freezing temperature (38°F)
💧 Severe dehydration (6 oz water/day)
😴 Sleep deprivation (minimal sleep for 4+ days)
🍽️ Malnutrition (limited food)
🤒 Illness (Haise's kidney infection)
😰 Exhaustion (complete physical drain)

Mental:
🧠 Stress (life-or-death situation)
😟 Isolation (long radio silences)
😨 Fear (will we make it?)
🎯 Pressure (must execute perfectly)
😤 Frustration (constant discomfort)

Yet They Performed:
✅ Built mailbox adapter
✅ Executed navigation burns
✅ Monitored systems continuously
✅ Made critical decisions
✅ Stayed calm under pressure
✅ Landed safely

=== COMPARISON TO ENDURANCE RECORDS ===
Apollo 13 vs Other Extremes:

Antarctic Explorers:
• Have warm shelters
• Have adequate food and water
• Can move around
• Ground beneath feet

Mountain Climbers:
• Can turn back
• Rescue possible
• Fresh air to breathe
• Gravity works normally

Submarine Crews:
• More space
• Adequate resources
• Can surface if needed
• Crew rotation for sleep

Apollo 13:
• NO warm shelter (38°F)
• NO adequate water (6 oz/day)
• NO room to move (160 cu ft)
• NO rescue possible
• NO turning back
• Must execute perfectly or die

=== THE HUMAN SPIRIT ===
What They Proved:

Humans Can Survive:
• 4+ days at 38°F
• Severe dehydration
• Complete sleep deprivation
• Extreme stress and fear
• Cramped, uncomfortable conditions

When Motivated By:
• Desire to live
• Trust in team
• Professional training
• Calm problem-solving
• Refusal to give up

Gene Kranz: "Failure is not an option."
Crew's Actions: Proved it.

=== THE RECOVERY ===
After Splashdown:

Immediate Medical Care:
• Rehydration (IV fluids)
• Warming (heated blankets)
• Rest (finally!)
• Medical monitoring

Recovery Time:
• Weeks to fully recover
• Fred Haise: Kidney infection treated
• Weight gain back to normal
• Psychological impact: lifelong

=== THE LESSON ===
The human body can endure incredible hardship.
The human spirit can overcome impossible odds.

When you have to survive,
You find a way.

When comfort isn't an option,
Endure.

When sleep is impossible,
Stay alert.

When water runs out,
Ration.

When it's freezing,
Shiver and continue.

Four days in hell.
Three men survived.

🥶 + 💧 + 😴 + 🚀 = 🏠

THEY MADE IT HOME.
DECISION POINT #6
SPEED UP BURN (PC+2)?
GET 79:27:40 | Wrong Ocean Landing Zone

GET 142:40:46 | Final Approach—The Re-Entry Corridor

=== THE SITUATION ===
▸ Final approach to Earth's atmosphere—one chance to get it right
▸ The Re-entry Corridor: Extremely narrow margin
  • Target angle: ~-6.5° (Apollo 13 aimed for ~-6.2°)
  • Acceptable window: roughly -5.25° to -7.4° (only ~2° margin!)
  • Too shallow (<-5.25°): Skip off atmosphere into space—lost forever
  • Too steep (>-7.4°): Burn up from excessive heat and g-forces
▸ Guidance computer powered down for 4 days (since GET ~56)
▸ CM freezing cold (38-50°F) with condensation and ice on walls

• All crew survived
• Computer performed flawlessly despite never being designed for shutdown/restart
• A frozen computer saved three lives
INFO SLIDE #7
RE-ENTRY CORRIDOR PHYSICS
The Narrow Path Between Life and Death

=== THE FINAL CHALLENGE ===
After 4 Days of Survival:

One Last Obstacle:
• Must hit Earth's atmosphere at EXACT angle
• Window of success: Only ~2° margin
• Too shallow = skip off into space forever
• Too steep = burn up from heat and g-forces
• No second chance

The Stakes: Get it perfect or die on live TV

=== THE PHYSICS OF RE-ENTRY ===
Why Is It So Hard?

Speed at Entry Interface:
• Velocity: ~25,000 mph (36,500 feet per second)
• That's 7 miles per second!
• Faster than a speeding bullet (×20)
• Kinetic energy must be dissipated

Friction with Atmosphere:
• Spacecraft rams into air molecules
• Air compresses (can't move out of way fast enough)
• Compression creates EXTREME heat
• Heat shield ablates (burns away) to dissipate energy

The Heat:
• Peak temperature: ~5,000°F (2,760°C)
• Hot enough to melt steel
• Hot enough to vaporize aluminum
• Heat shield chars and burns away (by design)

G-Forces:
• Deceleration from 25,000 mph to 0 mph
• Peak g-force: ~6-7 g's
• Crew weighs 6× normal weight
• Breathing difficult, vision blurred

=== THE RE-ENTRY CORRIDOR ===
The Narrow Path:

Entry Angle Definition:
• Measured relative to Earth's horizon
• Negative angle = downward path
• Apollo 13 target: ~-6.2° to -6.5°
• Acceptable range: -5.25° to -7.4°

Total Acceptable Window: ~2.15° margin
(That's narrower than a pencil held at arm's length!)

=== TOO SHALLOW: SKIP OFF ===
If Angle Less Steep Than -5.25°:

What Happens:
1. Spacecraft hits upper atmosphere
2. Not enough air to slow down significantly
3. Spacecraft SKIPS like stone on water
4. Ricochets back into space
5. Insufficient fuel to return
6. Lost in space forever

The Physics:
• Lift generated by capsule shape
• Air too thin to capture spacecraft
• Trajectory bends back upward
• Escape velocity maintained
• No way to turn around

The Outcome:
☠️ Oxygen runs out in hours
☠️ Crew freezes to death
☠️ Spacecraft becomes tomb in space
☠️ Orbits Earth or Sun forever
☠️ No rescue possible

Historical Close Call:
• Gemini 8 (1966) nearly skipped
• Apollo 11 had guidance error (corrected)
• Margin for error is REAL

=== TOO STEEP: BURN UP ===
If Angle Steeper Than -7.4°:

What Happens:
1. Spacecraft hits atmosphere too steeply
2. Massive air compression instantly
3. Heat shield overheats beyond design
4. G-forces exceed survivable limits
5. Spacecraft breaks apart or burns up

The Physics:
• Excessive atmospheric density
• Heat generation exceeds ablation rate
• Thermal protection fails
• Structural stress breaks capsule

Heat Shield Failure:
• Designed for specific heat load
• Too steep = heat exceeds capacity
• Shield burns through to cabin
• Interior exposed to plasma

G-Force Trauma:
• Peak g's exceed human tolerance
• Blood pooling in lower body
• Loss of consciousness (g-LOC)
• Potential death from g-forces alone

The Outcome:
☠️ Heat shield fails
☠️ Cabin burns up (5,000°F plasma)
☠️ Or g-forces kill crew
☠️ Or structural breakup
☠️ Fireball visible from ground

Historical Tragedy:
• Soyuz 1 (1967) - parachute failure, impact death
• Soyuz 11 (1971) - cabin depressurization
• Columbia (2003) - heat shield damage, breakup

=== THE PERFECT ANGLE ===
Target: -6.2° to -6.5° (Apollo 13)

What Happens:
✅ Controlled entry into atmosphere
✅ Heat within design limits
✅ G-forces survivable (6-7 g's)
✅ Predictable deceleration path
✅ Parachute deployment altitude reached
✅ Safe splashdown in ocean

The Entry Profile:
1. Entry Interface (400,000 ft / 120 km)
2. Peak heating (200,000 ft / 60 km)
3. Peak g-force (150,000 ft / 45 km)
4. Communication blackout (plasma)
5. Blackout ends (80,000 ft / 24 km)
6. Drogue chutes (24,000 ft / 7 km)
7. Main chutes (10,000 ft / 3 km)
8. Splashdown (sea level)

=== GUIDANCE CONTROL ===
How to Hit the Corridor:

The Guidance Computer:
• Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC)
• Calculates trajectory continuously
• Makes thousands of corrections
• Fires small thrusters to adjust angle
• Maintains precise path through corridor

Reaction Control System (RCS):
• 12 small thrusters on CM
• Fire in pulses (milliseconds)
• Adjust pitch, yaw, roll
• Computer controls automatically

Aerodynamic Lift:
• CM is NOT symmetric (offset center of gravity)
• Generates lift like tiny wing
• Computer uses lift to "steer"
• Can aim for Pacific landing zone

Manual Backup:
• Crew can override computer
• Hand controller for thrusters
• But nearly impossible to be accurate enough
• Computer is essential for survival

=== THE APOLLO 13 CHALLENGE ===
Why Re-entry Was Even Harder:

The Frozen Computer:
• Guidance computer powered down for 4 days
• Temperature: 38°F (not designed for this)
• Condensation and ice on circuits
• NOT designed to shutdown and restart
• Unknown if it would work

The Risk:
• If computer fails to restart → manual control
• Manual control → low probability of success
• Exhausted crew after 4 days of hell
• One chance to get it right

The Decision: Risk the computer restart
• Engineers designed careful power-up sequence
• Crew held their breath...
• Computer restarted! ✅
• Systems came online
• Guidance active

The Execution:
• Computer controlled re-entry
• Made thousands of micro-adjustments
• Kept spacecraft in corridor perfectly
• Entry angle: -6.2° (PERFECT!)

=== COMMUNICATION BLACKOUT ===
The Plasma Sheath:

During Re-entry:
• Heat creates ionized plasma around spacecraft
• Plasma blocks radio waves
• All communications CUT OFF
• Ground has no idea if crew is alive

Expected Blackout: 3-4 minutes

Apollo 13 Blackout: 4 minutes 24 seconds
• Longer than normal (deeper entry?)
• Mission Control tense
• Families terrified
• World watching

Then: "Okay, Joe." (Swigert's voice)
• Cheers erupt!
• They survived!
• They're coming home!

=== THE PARACHUTES ===
Final Phase:

Parachute Sequence:
1. Drogue Chutes (24,000 ft):
   • Two small chutes deploy
   • Stabilize spacecraft
   • Slow from 300 mph to 175 mph

2. Main Chutes (10,000 ft):
   • Three massive orange-and-white chutes
   • Each 83 feet diameter
   • Slow to 22 mph for splashdown

The Worry:
• Will parachutes deploy after 4 days frozen?
• Mechanisms could be frozen
• Pyrotechnic charges might fail

The Reality:
• All parachutes deployed perfectly
• Beautiful sight from TV cameras
• Three chutes blooming
• Odyssey descending safely

=== SPLASHDOWN ACCURACY ===
The Target:

Landing Zone:
• Pacific Ocean
• Near USS Iwo Jima (recovery ship)
• Specific coordinates radioed

Apollo 13 Splashdown:
• Distance from ship: 3.5 miles
• Essentially perfect!
• Computer-guided re-entry worked flawlessly
• Despite frozen restart, manual alignment, damaged systems

The Math:
• Traveled 240,000+ miles
• Aimed for target size of small island
• Hit within 3.5 miles
• Accuracy: 99.999%

=== THE MIRACLE ===
What Had to Go Right:

✅ Free-return trajectory burn (perfect)
✅ PC+2 speed-up burn (perfect)
✅ Manual navigation using Sun/Earth (worked)
✅ Mid-course corrections (on target)
✅ Battery jump-start (successful)
✅ Frozen computer restart (miraculous)
✅ Guidance system operation (flawless)
✅ Re-entry angle (perfect -6.2°)
✅ Heat shield integrity (held together)
✅ Parachute deployment (all three chutes)
✅ Splashdown accuracy (3.5 miles from ship)

Any ONE failure = death

=== THE NUMBERS ===
Re-entry Statistics:

Entry Velocity: ~25,000 mph
Peak Heat: ~5,000°F
Peak G-Force: 6-7 g's
Blackout Duration: 4 min 24 sec
Entry Angle: -6.2° (perfect!)
Acceptable Range: -5.25° to -7.4°
Margin of Error: ±1.15° (less than 2°)
Landing Accuracy: 3.5 miles from target
Crew Survival: 100% ✅

=== DID YOU KNOW? ===
Re-entry Facts:

• Heat shield ablates (burns) ~1 inch during re-entry
• Charred material carries away heat
• This is BY DESIGN (not a failure)

• Peak g-forces compress crew into couches
• Lovell: "It felt like someone sitting on my chest"
• Training in centrifuge prepared them

• Plasma blackout creates "ion sheath"
• Radio waves can't penetrate
• Like trying to talk through fire

• Apollo 13's re-entry was nominal (perfect)
• Despite everything that went wrong before
• The computer saved their lives

=== THE LESSON ===
Physics doesn't care about your problems.
Hit the corridor or die.

The numbers don't lie:
• Too shallow: Skip off and float forever
• Too steep: Burn up in fireball
• Just right: Live

Precision matters.
Computers save lives.
Math works.

And three men came through fire
To land safely in the ocean.

INFO SLIDE #9
KEY SAVES: APOLLO 12 & THE POWER HEROES
"SCE to AUX" and the Team That Saved Apollo 13

=== TWO MISSIONS, ONE HERO ===
John Aaron — The EECOM Who Saved Two Missions

Apollo 12 (November 1969):
• Lightning strike during launch
• John Aaron: "SCE to AUX"
• Mission saved

Apollo 13 (April 1970):
• Explosion crippled spacecraft
• John Aaron: Led all power planning
• Crew saved

The Connection: Same engineer, same calm problem-solving, both times critical

=== APOLLO 12: "SCE TO AUX" ===
The Lightning Strike Crisis:

Launch Day — November 14, 1969:
• Apollo 12 lifts off in rainy weather
• 36.5 seconds after liftoff: LIGHTNING STRIKE #1
• A few seconds later: LIGHTNING STRIKE #2
• Both strikes hit the tall Saturn V rocket

What Happened:
• Every warning light in spacecraft turned ON
• Fuel cell gauges: crazy readings
• Electrical systems: total confusion
• Telemetry to ground: garbage data
• Computer displays: nonsense
• Crew: "We just lost the platform!"

In Mission Control:
• Screens showing chaos
• No one understands what's wrong
• Flight Director: considers ABORT
• Clock ticking: 10 seconds to decide
• Launch costs $375 million (1969 dollars)

John Aaron (EECOM — Electrical Systems):
• Sees strange pattern in data
• Remembers similar pattern from obscure test 1 year earlier
• Makes the call...

The Miracle Words:
John Aaron: "Flight, try SCE to AUX."

Flight Director: "What?"

John Aaron: "SCE to AUX!"

CapCom (to crew): "Apollo 12, Houston. Try SCE to AUX."

Pete Conrad (Commander): "SCE to what??"

Alan Bean (Lunar Module Pilot):
• Remembers the switch from training
• Tiny switch, rarely used
• Panel 16, under his hand
• Flips it to AUXILIARY

Result:
✅ Telemetry instantly restored
✅ Data flowing to Mission Control
✅ Systems reading normally
✅ Mission continues
✅ Successful Moon landing!

What "SCE to AUX" Did:
• SCE = Signal Conditioning Electronics
• Normal mode overloaded by lightning surge
• AUX mode used backup signal path
• Cleared the electrical confusion
• Simple switch flip = mission saved

The Legend Begins:
• John Aaron became famous
• "Steely-eyed missile man" (Gene Kranz)
• Calm under pressure
• Knew obscure switch from memory
• Saved $375 million mission in 10 seconds

=== APOLLO 13: JOHN AARON'S POWER LEADERSHIP ===
After the Explosion — April 13, 1970:

The Crisis:
• Oxygen tanks damaged
• Fuel cells offline
• Running on batteries only
• Limited power for 4+ days
• Must manage every single amp

Gene Kranz's Decision:
• Flight Director Gene Kranz had ultimate authority
• But he knew: This is a power/consumables problem
• John Aaron (EECOM) was the best

The Order:
Flight Director Gene Kranz put John Aaron in charge of:
✅ ALL power management for BOTH spacecraft
✅ ALL consumables (oxygen, water, batteries)
✅ VETO authority over checklist items
✅ Final say on what systems stay on/off

Translation: If John Aaron said "No power for that," it didn't happen.

Why This Mattered:
• Normally, many people share authority
• Flight Director decides most things
• But Kranz trusted Aaron completely
• Gave him full power control
• One person = clear decisions

=== THE POWER TEAM ===
Key Players Saving Apollo 13:

John Aaron (EECOM):
• In charge of all electrical and environmental systems
• Led all power and consumables planning
• Veto authority over procedures
• Made final calls on power budget

Arnie Aldrich:
• Kept the master checklists
• Documented every procedure
• Made sure nothing was forgotten
• Coordinated between teams

Bill Peters:
• Led work to turn LM into "survival vehicle"
• Figured out how to make LM support 3 for 4+ days
• Designed power-down procedures
• Created LM lifeboat operations

Jim Kelly:
• Led the battery charging procedure
• Figured out how to charge CM from LM
• Never attempted before in space
• Worked with Bill Peters on procedures

The Team Effort:
• John Aaron shaped overall power strategy
• Bill Peters made LM a lifeboat
• Jim Kelly solved battery charging
• Arnie Aldrich kept everything organized
• Hundreds of engineers supported them

=== CHARGING CM BATTERIES FROM LM ===
The Never-Before-Attempted Procedure:

The Problem (GET ~122-126):
• Command Module batteries at 2% (nearly dead)
• Need full power for re-entry computers and parachutes
• Lunar Module has remaining battery power
• Must transfer power LM → CM
• Never tested, could short-circuit and kill both systems

Mission Control's Solution:
• John Aaron continued shaping entry power-up plan
• Jim Kelly led the actual charging procedure
• Bill Peters helped with LM systems
• Team designed step-by-step process in real-time
• Radioed instructions to crew

The Execution:
1. Connect LM batteries to CM charging system
2. Carefully monitor voltage and current
3. Watch for short-circuits or overheating
4. Charge CM batteries enough for re-entry
5. Disconnect before anything fails

The Moment:
• Crew followed instructions precisely
• Power flowing from LM to CM
• One battery briefly "dropped off the line" (scary!)
• But it came back online
• Charging successful!

Result:
✅ CM batteries charged to sufficient levels
✅ Re-entry computers have power
✅ Parachutes will deploy
✅ Crew can come home
✅ Procedure added to NASA emergency playbook

Without This:
• Dead CM batteries = no re-entry computer
• No computer = can't hit re-entry corridor
• Can't hit corridor = skip off or burn up
• Battery charging made survival possible

=== POWER BUDGET MANAGEMENT ===
Every Amp Mattered:

The Challenge:
• LM batteries designed for 45-hour Moon landing
• Apollo 13 needed 87+ hours (nearly double!)
• Every system drains power
• Run out = death

John Aaron's Decisions:
What Stayed ON:
✅ Life support (oxygen circulation)
✅ Minimal cabin lights (just enough to see)
✅ CO2 scrubbers (must breathe)
✅ Attitude control (point spacecraft correctly)
✅ Essential communications (but reduced!)

What Turned OFF:
❌ Heaters (temperature dropped to 38°F)
❌ Most cabin lights (stumbling in dark)
❌ Non-essential electronics
❌ High-power radio amplifier (used backup)
❌ Guidance computer (except during burns)

The Result:
• Batteries lasted entire journey
• 20% power remaining at splashdown
• Extremely close call
• But they made it!

=== THE ENTRY POWER-UP PLAN ===
John Aaron's Final Challenge:

The Problem (GET ~141:30):
• Must power up Command Module for re-entry
• Frozen at 38°F for 4 days
• Condensation everywhere
• Guidance computer not designed for shutdown/restart
• Normal startup: 3 hours
• Time available: 2 hours
• Must work first time or crew dies

John Aaron's Plan:
• Designed careful power-up sequence
• Every step calculated for minimum power use
• Every system brought online in precise order
• Built-in checks to detect problems early
• Crew could abort sequence if needed

The Systems:
1. Heaters (warm up critical components)
2. Guidance computer (frozen for 4 days)
3. Navigation platform (must align)
4. Life support (oxygen, cooling)
5. Communications (stay in touch)
6. Parachute systems (arm for deployment)

The Execution:
• Crew followed Aaron's procedure exactly
• Systems came online one by one
• Guidance computer restarted (miracle!)
• Navigation aligned successfully
• All systems GO for re-entry

Result:
✅ Power-up completed in 2 hours
✅ Computer worked despite being frozen
✅ Perfect re-entry
✅ Safe splashdown
✅ All three crew alive

=== THE HEROES BEHIND THE HEROES ===
While Crew Was in Space:

• But he filed it away mentally
• Recognized it instantly under pressure
• 10 seconds to make the call

Apollo 13 Power Budget:
• Every single system calculated to the amp
• Margins so tight that extra radio call could matter
• 20% battery remaining = less than 1 hour of power left
• If re-entry took 10 minutes longer, might have died
• Perfect planning made survival possible

=== QUOTES TO REMEMBER ===
Words from the Heroes:

Gene Kranz (on John Aaron):
"John Aaron is a steely-eyed missile man."
(Highest compliment in Mission Control)

John Aaron (on both missions):
"I just did my job. The crew did the hard part."

Alan Bean (Apollo 12):
"I don't know what that switch does, but I know where it is!"
(After flipping SCE to AUX)

Pete Conrad (Apollo 12):
"I think we got hit by lightning!"
(Understatement of the mission)

Jim Lovell (Apollo 13):
"The guys on the ground saved us. We just followed instructions."

=== THE LEGACY ===
How These Saves Changed NASA:

From Apollo 12:
✅ Never launch in lightning conditions (new rule)
✅ Weather constraints tightened
✅ Backup signal paths better understood
✅ Obscure switches now part of main training

Apollo 13: Power leadership → Crew saved over 4 days

Different problems.
Same principles:
✅ Know your stuff
✅ Stay calm
✅ Trust the team
✅ Work the problem

John Aaron and his team:
• Didn't panic
• Used their training
• Made hard calls
• Saved lives

Future Missions (Artemis, Mars):
• Apollo 13 lessons still studied
• Redundancy principles applied
• Contingency planning essential
• Crew safety paramount

=== HUMAN LESSONS ===
What Apollo 13 Taught the World:

STAY CALM UNDER PRESSURE:
• Panic kills, calm problem-solving saves
• "Work the problem"
• Focus on what you can control
• One step at a time

TRUST YOUR TEAM:
• Crew trusted Mission Control
• Mission Control trusted crew
• Engineers trusted each other
• Teamwork = survival

NEVER GIVE UP:
• Situation seemed hopeless
• 200,000 miles from home
• Crippled spacecraft
• Yet they found a way

IMPROVISE AND ADAPT:
• When perfect fails, improvise
• Use what you have
• Think creatively
• Simple solutions work

=== THE FINAL LESSON ===
What Made Apollo 13 a Success:

NOT the Technology:
• Computer froze but restarted
• Duct tape, not advanced materials
• Manual navigation, not automation

NOT Perfect Planning:
• Explosion was unexpected
• Procedures written in real-time
• Many improvisations required

BUT the People:
✅ Engineers who solved impossible problems
✅ Crew who stayed calm under stress
✅ Flight directors who made tough calls
✅ Families who kept faith
✅ Public who rallied in support

Gene Kranz: "Failure is not an option."
But he didn't mean never fail.
He meant never stop trying.

=== QUOTES TO REMEMBER ===
Words of Wisdom:

Gene Kranz:
"When bad things happened, we just calmly laid out all the options, and failure was not one of them."

Jim Lovell:
"Houston, we've had a problem."
(Calm, factual, no panic)

Ken Mattingly (pulled from flight):
"I was asked why I didn't resent being pulled from the mission. I told them because the malfunction would have happened whether I was there or not, and they needed my help on the ground."

Jack Swigert (after splashdown):
"I'm grateful to be here."

Fred Haise:
"We didn't go to the Moon, but we went somewhere no one expected."
