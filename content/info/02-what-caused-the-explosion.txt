INFO SLIDE #2
WHAT CAUSED THE EXPLOSION?
Oxygen Tank #2 ‚Äî A Chain of Small Mistakes

=== THE SIMPLE ANSWER ===
Oxygen tank #2 in the Service Module exploded at GET 55:54:53

But WHY did it explode?
The real answer: Three mistakes over two years.

=== MISTAKE #1: THE DROP (1968) ===
During Manufacturing:

What Happened:
‚Ä¢ Oxygen Tank #2 was dropped about 2 inches
‚Ä¢ Happened during removal before it was installed in Apollo 13's Service Module
‚Ä¢ This likely damaged its fill/drain line inside
‚Ä¢ Workers inspected the outside: looked fine
‚Ä¢ Internal damage NOT detected

The Problem:
‚Ä¢ Fill/drain system probably bent or cracked
‚Ä¢ Would cause trouble later during testing
‚Ä¢ But no one knew yet

Result: Hidden damage went unnoticed

=== MISTAKE #2: THE DESIGN CHANGE (1965) ===
The Voltage Mismatch:

Original Design:
‚Ä¢ All spacecraft systems ran on 28 volts
‚Ä¢ Thermostatic switches designed for 28 volts
‚Ä¢ Everything matched and worked safely

NASA's Change:
‚Ä¢ Upgraded ground test equipment to 65 volts
‚Ä¢ More powerful, better for testing
‚Ä¢ MOST components upgraded to handle 65 volts
‚Ä¢ BUT: Tiny thermostat switches NOT upgraded (still rated for 28V)

Why It Mattered:
‚Ä¢ Higher voltage = more heat in switches
‚Ä¢ Switches designed for 28V now carrying 65V
‚Ä¢ If they got too hot, they could weld shut
‚Ä¢ Then they couldn't turn off the heaters!

Result: Safety system compromised

=== MISTAKE #3: THE TESTING INCIDENT (March 1970) ===
Pre-Launch Ground Test (CDDT):

The Test:
‚Ä¢ March 1970 - About one month before launch
‚Ä¢ Fill oxygen tank for countdown test
‚Ä¢ Time to drain tank after test is done
‚Ä¢ Normal drain valve wouldn't work (damaged from drop?)

The "Solution":
‚Ä¢ Workers couldn't drain tank normally
‚Ä¢ So they used heaters and fans to boil off the oxygen
‚Ä¢ Ran ground power at ~65 volts
‚Ä¢ Left heaters running for about 8 HOURS to empty tank

What Actually Happened:
‚Ä¢ Temperature inside tank reached ~1,000¬∞F (540¬∞C!)
‚Ä¢ That's hot enough to melt aluminum
‚Ä¢ But temperature gauge only read up to 85¬∞F
‚Ä¢ Workers saw 85¬∞F and thought everything was fine
‚Ä¢ Real temperature was 12√ó hotter than gauge could show!

The Damage:
‚Ä¢ Thermostat switches welded shut from extreme heat
‚Ä¢ Teflon wire insulation melted and burned off
‚Ä¢ Bare electrical wires exposed inside tank
‚Ä¢ Pure oxygen environment (extremely flammable)
‚Ä¢ Bomb waiting to explode

Warning Signs Missed:
‚Ä¢ Unusual readings during test
‚Ä¢ But technicians didn't understand what they meant
‚Ä¢ Tank passed pressure tests (pressure was fine)
‚Ä¢ Exterior looked normal
‚Ä¢ Cleared for flight

Result: Damaged tank loaded onto Apollo 13

=== THE EXPLOSION (April 13, 1970) ===
GET 55:54:53 ‚Äî Routine Request, Catastrophic Result:

Mission Control's Request:
"We'd like you to stir up your cryo tanks."

Standard Procedure:
‚Ä¢ Stir oxygen fans to get accurate readings
‚Ä¢ Done many times on every mission
‚Ä¢ Should take 10 seconds
‚Ä¢ Completely routine

What Happened:
1. Jack Swigert flips switch to activate Tank #2 fans
2. Electricity flows through DAMAGED WIRING
3. Bare wires spark inside tank
4. Spark ignites in pure oxygen environment
5. Fire spreads instantly (oxygen makes everything burn)
6. Pressure builds rapidly
7. EXPLOSION rips through tank
8. Blast blows off entire 13-foot panel from Service Module
9. Damages Tank #1 (now leaking oxygen)
10. Fuel cells fail (need oxygen to make power)
11. Spacecraft crippled 200,000 miles from Earth

The Physics:
‚Ä¢ Pure oxygen makes fire burn 10√ó hotter and faster
‚Ä¢ 900+ psi pressure released like bomb
‚Ä¢ Explosion visible through windows ("sparklies")
‚Ä¢ Oxygen venting into space like jet
‚Ä¢ Spacecraft tumbling from blast

=== THE TIMELINE ===
How Three Mistakes Combined:

1968: Tank dropped ‚Üí Fill line damaged
1965: Voltage upgrade ‚Üí Switches can't handle heat
March 1970: 8-hour heater test ‚Üí Wiring burned
April 13, 1970: Routine stir ‚Üí EXPLOSION

Any ONE mistake prevented = no explosion
All three mistakes together = disaster

=== THE DAMAGE ===
What the Explosion Destroyed:

Service Module:
‚ùå Oxygen Tank #2: Completely destroyed (exploded)
‚ùå Oxygen Tank #1: Damaged, leaking rapidly
‚ùå Fuel Cell 1: Offline (no oxygen to make power)
‚ùå Fuel Cell 2: Offline (no oxygen to make power)
‚ùå Fuel Cell 3: Offline (no oxygen to make power)
‚ùå Side panel: Entire 13-foot section blown off
‚ùå High-gain antenna: Damaged
‚ö†Ô∏è Main engine (SPS): Unknown damage, unsafe to use

Command Module:
‚ö†Ô∏è Running on batteries only (fuel cells dead)
‚ö†Ô∏è Oxygen leaking from damaged Service Module
‚ö†Ô∏è Must power down to save batteries
‚ö†Ô∏è Temperature will drop to freezing

Lunar Module "Aquarius":
‚úÖ Completely undamaged (separate from explosion)
‚úÖ Own oxygen supply (independent tanks)
‚úÖ Own power (separate batteries)
‚úÖ Becomes the lifeboat that saves three lives

=== WHY THIS MATTERS ===
Lessons About Safety:

Small Problems Can Become Big:
‚Ä¢ 2-inch drop seemed minor
‚Ä¢ Voltage mismatch seemed unimportant
‚Ä¢ 8-hour test seemed normal
‚Ä¢ Together: nearly killed three men

Check Everything Carefully:
‚Ä¢ Inspect inside, not just outside
‚Ä¢ Match voltage ratings exactly
‚Ä¢ Watch for unusual readings
‚Ä¢ Don't assume "looks fine" means "is fine"

Multiple Backups Save Lives:
‚Ä¢ Tank #1 damaged but LM had oxygen
‚Ä¢ Fuel cells failed but LM had batteries
‚Ä¢ Main engine unsafe but LM engine worked
‚Ä¢ Redundancy meant survival

=== WHAT NASA CHANGED ===
After Apollo 13:

Oxygen Tank Redesign:
‚úÖ Added third oxygen tank (more redundancy)
‚úÖ Put third tank in different location (separate from #1 and #2)
‚úÖ Upgraded all thermostatic switches to proper voltage
‚úÖ Better wire insulation (won't burn in oxygen)
‚úÖ Redesigned heaters (safer, can't overheat)
‚úÖ Temperature gauges read full range (no hidden overheating)

Testing Improvements:
‚úÖ Never use heaters to drain tanks (new drain procedures)
‚úÖ X-ray inspect all pressure vessels
‚úÖ Document every unusual reading (investigate fully)
‚úÖ Double-check voltage ratings on ALL components
‚úÖ Temperature monitoring during all tests

Inspection Rules:
‚úÖ Report all drops, no matter how small
‚úÖ Full internal inspection after any damage
‚úÖ Don't launch if anything seems unusual
‚úÖ "When in doubt, check it out"

Every Apollo Mission After:
‚Ä¢ Used redesigned oxygen tanks
‚Ä¢ Safer testing procedures
‚Ä¢ More careful inspections
‚Ä¢ Zero oxygen tank failures

=== DID YOU KNOW? ===
Strange Facts:

‚Ä¢ The explosion happened at 13:13 military time (Houston)
‚Ä¢ Mission number: Apollo 13
‚Ä¢ Launch date: 4/11/70 (add digits: 4+1+1 = 6, plus 7+0 = 7... both unlucky?)
‚Ä¢ Superstitious? Maybe just coincidence.

‚Ä¢ The actual cause wasn't discovered until months after landing
‚Ä¢ Investigation took 3,000+ hours of testing
‚Ä¢ Engineers recreated the damage in lab
‚Ä¢ Found melted Teflon inside test tanks

‚Ä¢ Tank #2 was originally built for Apollo 10
‚Ä¢ Moved to Apollo 13 after modifications
‚Ä¢ If it had stayed on Apollo 10, might have exploded there instead
‚Ä¢ Apollo 10 crew: Very lucky

=== THE LESSON ===
Not Bad Luck. Bad Wiring.

Three mistakes:
1. DROP (damaged fill line)
2. VOLTAGE (switches couldn't handle it)
3. TEST (8 hours of hidden overheating)

One explosion.
Three men survived.
Countless lessons learned.

Don't blame superstition.
Blame damage no one caught.

And remember:
Small mistakes add up.
Check everything twice.
Safety always matters.

üí• Three Mistakes ‚Üí One Explosion ‚Üí Zero Deaths

CAUSE IDENTIFIED. CREW SAVED. NEVER REPEATED.
