INFO SLIDE #2
WHAT CAUSED THE EXPLOSION?
The Chain of Events That Nearly Killed Three Men

=== THE SIMPLE ANSWER ===
Oxygen tank #2 in the Service Module exploded at GET 55:54:53

But WHY did it explode?
The real answer: A series of small mistakes over many months.

=== THE OXYGEN TANKS ===
Design Purpose:
‚Ä¢ Store oxygen as supercold liquid (-297¬∞F / -183¬∞C)
‚Ä¢ Feed fuel cells to generate electricity
‚Ä¢ Provide breathing oxygen for crew
‚Ä¢ Two tanks for redundancy

Tank Specifications:
‚Ä¢ Highly insulated spheres
‚Ä¢ Stored at high pressure (900+ psi)
‚Ä¢ Internal heater to boil oxygen into gas
‚Ä¢ Stirring fans to prevent stratification
‚Ä¢ Thermostatic switches to control temperature

Should be perfectly safe... but...

=== MISTAKE #1: THE DROP (1968) ===
During Manufacturing:
‚Ä¢ Oxygen tank #2 installed in Service Module
‚Ä¢ During removal for modification: DROPPED 2 inches
‚Ä¢ Technicians inspected exterior: looked fine
‚Ä¢ Internal damage NOT detected
‚Ä¢ Jarring may have loosened components inside

Result: Potential internal damage went unnoticed

=== MISTAKE #2: DESIGN CHANGE (1965) ===
The Voltage Problem:
‚Ä¢ Original design: 28-volt system
‚Ä¢ NASA changed to 65-volt system for better performance
‚Ä¢ MOST components upgraded to 65 volts
‚Ä¢ BUT: Thermostatic switches NOT upgraded (still rated for 28V)

Why It Mattered:
‚Ä¢ Higher voltage = more current = more heat
‚Ä¢ Switches designed for 28V now carrying 65V
‚Ä¢ Switches could fuse shut if overheated

Result: Safety system compromised

=== MISTAKE #3: THE TESTING INCIDENT (March 1970) ===
Pre-Launch Ground Test:
‚Ä¢ Filling tanks with oxygen for test
‚Ä¢ Time to drain tank #2 after test
‚Ä¢ Normal drain valve wouldn't work (damaged from drop?)
‚Ä¢ Engineers improvised: Used HEATERS to boil off oxygen
‚Ä¢ Heaters ran for 8 HOURS continuously

The Problem:
‚Ä¢ Temperature inside tank reached ~1000¬∞F (540¬∞C)
‚Ä¢ Far above safe limits (normal: ~80¬∞F max)
‚Ä¢ Thermostatic switches fused shut from heat
‚Ä¢ Teflon insulation on wiring BURNED and peeled
‚Ä¢ Exposed bare wires inside oxygen-rich environment

Warning Signs Missed:
‚Ä¢ Technicians noted unusual readings
‚Ä¢ But didn't understand significance
‚Ä¢ Tank passed pressure tests
‚Ä¢ Exterior looked fine
‚Ä¢ Cleared for flight

Result: Bomb waiting to explode

=== THE FATEFUL MOMENT ===
April 13, 1970 - GET 55:54:53

Mission Control's Request:
"We'd like you to stir up your cryo tanks."

Standard Procedure:
‚Ä¢ Stir oxygen to get accurate quantity readings
‚Ä¢ Done dozens of times on previous missions
‚Ä¢ Should take 10 seconds

What Happened:
1. Swigert flips switch to activate tank #2 fans
2. Fans turn on, electricity flows
3. Current passes through DAMAGED WIRING (exposed from overheating)
4. Spark ignites in oxygen-rich environment
5. EXPLOSION rips through tank
6. Blast blows off 13-foot panel
7. Damages tank #1 (now leaking)
8. Fuel cells fail (need oxygen)
9. Spacecraft crippled

=== THE EXPLOSION PHYSICS ===
What Made It So Destructive:

Pure Oxygen Environment:
‚Ä¢ Oxygen makes everything burn MUCH hotter and faster
‚Ä¢ Even metals burn in pure oxygen
‚Ä¢ Small spark = massive fire

High Pressure:
‚Ä¢ 900+ psi stored pressure
‚Ä¢ Explosion released like bomb
‚Ä¢ Pressure wave shattered structure

Structural Damage:
‚Ä¢ Entire panel (13 feet) ripped off
‚Ä¢ Internal components exposed to space
‚Ä¢ Oxygen venting into vacuum
‚Ä¢ Debris field created around spacecraft

=== THE DAMAGE ASSESSMENT ===
Service Module:
‚ùå Oxygen tank #2: Destroyed (exploded)
‚ùå Oxygen tank #1: Damaged, leaking
‚ùå Fuel cell 1: Offline (no oxygen)
‚ùå Fuel cell 2: Offline (no oxygen)
‚ùå Fuel cell 3: Offline (no oxygen)
‚ùå Exterior panel: Blown off
‚ùå High-gain antenna: Damaged
‚ö†Ô∏è Main engine (SPS): Unknown condition, unsafe to use

Command Module:
‚ö†Ô∏è Battery power only (fuel cells dead)
‚ö†Ô∏è Oxygen supply from damaged SM
‚ö†Ô∏è Heat from electrical systems (must power down)
‚ö†Ô∏è Life support limited by oxygen

Lunar Module (Unaffected):
‚úÖ Fully functional
‚úÖ Independent oxygen supply
‚úÖ Battery power available
‚úÖ Descent engine operational
‚úÖ Becomes lifeboat

=== THE ROOT CAUSES ===
Contributing Factors:

1. Manufacturing: Tank dropped during installation
2. Design flaw: Voltage mismatch (28V switches on 65V circuit)
3. Testing error: 8-hour heater burn damaged insulation
4. Inspection failure: Damage not detected
5. Bad luck: Multiple failures aligned perfectly

Any ONE of these prevented = no explosion

=== LESSONS LEARNED ===
After Apollo 13:

Oxygen Tank Redesign:
‚úÖ Added third oxygen tank for redundancy
‚úÖ Improved thermostatic switches (proper voltage rating)
‚úÖ Better insulation and wiring
‚úÖ Redesigned heating elements
‚úÖ Improved testing procedures

Inspection Improvements:
‚úÖ More thorough internal inspections
‚úÖ Better documentation of anomalies
‚úÖ X-ray inspection of critical components
‚úÖ Temperature monitoring during tests

Spacecraft Changes:
‚úÖ LM validated as backup lifeboat
‚úÖ Emergency procedures expanded
‚úÖ Additional battery capacity in CM
‚úÖ Water storage increased

The Price of Learning:
‚Ä¢ Could have been three deaths
‚Ä¢ Instead: successful rescue
‚Ä¢ Every Apollo mission after was safer
‚Ä¢ NASA's finest hour of problem-solving

=== THE INVESTIGATION ===
NASA Review Board Found:

Primary Cause: Damaged Teflon insulation on wiring inside oxygen tank #2
Contributing Factors: Drop during manufacturing + inadequate testing

Blame: No single person responsible - systemic issues

Outcome: Complete redesign of oxygen tank systems

=== DID YOU KNOW? ===
Strange Facts:

‚Ä¢ The explosion happened at 13:13 military time (1:13 PM) in Houston
‚Ä¢ Mission launched April 11 (4/11... add digits: 4+1+1 = 6... twice 13 = 13!)
‚Ä¢ Superstitious? Apollo 13 had plenty of "bad luck" numbers

But luck had nothing to do with it.
It was wiring, oxygen, and a spark.

And three men who refused to die.
