DECISION POINT #8
BATTERY JUMP-START?
GET ~138:00:00 | Dead Batteries for Re-Entry

=== THE SITUATION ===
â–¸ Approaching Earthâ€”Command Module needed for re-entry (only module with heat shield)
â–¸ CM batteries drained to 2% during 4-day power-down
â–¸ LM has remaining battery power available
â–¸ Need to transfer power from LM to CM to charge batteries
â–¸ Procedure never testedâ€”could short-circuit both systems
â–¸ Without power, CM computers, parachutes, and life support won't function

=== OPTION 1: USE ONLY CM RESERVE BATTERIES ===
Subtitle: Attempt re-entry with 2% battery power

PROS:
â€¢ No risk of short-circuit damaging systems
â€¢ Avoids untested procedure
â€¢ Simpleâ€”no complex power transfer
â€¢ Can't make batteries worse than they are

CONS:
â€¢ Insufficient power for guidance computers
â€¢ Not enough power for parachute deployment
â€¢ Life support systems won't function
â€¢ Crew will die during re-entry
â€¢ 2% power = certain death

=== OPTION 2: JUMP-START FROM LM ===
Subtitle: Connect LM batteries to charge CM systems

PROS:
â€¢ Can fully charge CM batteries for re-entry
â€¢ Provides power for computers and navigation
â€¢ Enables parachute deployment systems
â€¢ Only option with chance of survival
â€¢ LM power otherwise wasted after jettison

CONS:
â€¢ Never attempted in spaceâ€”completely improvised
â€¢ Could short-circuit both LM and CM systems
â€¢ Might electrocute crew through metal hulls
â€¢ Could lose ALL remaining power
â€¢ Electrical fire risk in oxygen environment
â€¢ If it fails, no backup plan

=== DECISION PROMPT ===
ðŸ¤” WHAT SHOULD THE CREW DO?

=== HISTORICAL DECISION ===
NASA chose ATTEMPT THE JUMP-START
â€¢ Houston designed brand-new power-up procedure (never done before)
â€¢ Connected LM batteries to CM charging system
â€¢ Successfully transferred power without short-circuit
â€¢ One CM battery briefly "dropped off the line" but recovered
â€¢ Charged CM batteries to sufficient levels for re-entry
â€¢ Procedure worked perfectlyâ€”added to NASA emergency playbook
â€¢ This made re-entry possibleâ€”without it, crew would have died
