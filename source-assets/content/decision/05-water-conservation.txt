DECISION POINT #5
WATER CONSERVATION STRATEGY
GET ~85:00:00 | Critical Water Shortage

=== THE SITUATION ===
â–¸ Water supplies critically low
â–¸ Water needed for three vital purposes:
  1. Drinking water for crew (survival)
  2. Cooling systems for electronics (prevents overheating/fire)
  3. Humidification for breathing (prevents lung damage)
â–¸ Current consumption rate: will run dry 18 hours before splashdown
â–¸ Must drastically reduce usage or risk death/equipment failure

=== OPTION 1: EQUAL RATIONING ===
Subtitle: Distribute water evenly across all three systems

PROS:
â€¢ Balanced approachâ€”no single system completely fails
â€¢ Maintains all systems partially functional
â€¢ Democratic distribution of scarce resource
â€¢ Reduces guilt over prioritization decisions

CONS:
â€¢ All three systems degraded simultaneously
â€¢ Moderate crew dehydration affects judgment
â€¢ Moderate equipment risk of overheating
â€¢ Moderate breathing discomfort
â€¢ May not save enoughâ€”could lose everything

=== OPTION 2: PRIORITIZE DRINKING WATER ===
Subtitle: Give crew adequate water, minimize cooling/humidification

PROS:
â€¢ Crew stays hydrated and alert for critical decisions
â€¢ Sharp minds for re-entry procedures
â€¢ Humans can survive dry air temporarily
â€¢ Crew comfort maximized

CONS:
â€¢ Electronics risk overheating and failure
â€¢ Air becomes painfully dry
â€¢ Potential equipment fires
â€¢ Could lose navigation/guidance systems
â€¢ Breathing discomfort causes fatigue

=== OPTION 3: PRIORITIZE EQUIPMENT COOLING ===
Subtitle: Keep electronics safe, minimize drinking water

PROS:
â€¢ Prevents electrical fires
â€¢ Maintains navigation and guidance systems
â€¢ Ensures re-entry computer functionality
â€¢ Equipment reliability maximized

CONS:
â€¢ Severe crew dehydration (dangerous)
â€¢ Impaired judgment and decision-making
â€¢ Physical weakness for re-entry procedures
â€¢ Crew might not survive to use equipment
â€¢ Medical complications from dehydration

=== DECISION PROMPT ===
ðŸ¤” WHAT SHOULD THE CREW DO?

=== HISTORICAL DECISION ===
NASA chose EXTREME RATIONINGâ€”prioritize survival
â€¢ Reduced to 6 ounces of water per person per day (normal: 64 oz)
â€¢ That's less than 1 cup per day!
â€¢ Minimal equipment coolingâ€”accepted risk of overheating
â€¢ Minimal humidificationâ€”crew endured dry, painful breathing
â€¢ Combined crew weight loss: 31.5 pounds
â€¢ Haise developed kidney infection from dehydration
â€¢ Systems held together just long enough to get home
