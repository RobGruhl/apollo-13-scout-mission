DECISION POINT #2
FREEZE OR SQUEEZE?
GET ~56:00:00 | Command Module Failing

=== THE SITUATION ===
â–¸ Command Module "Odyssey" losing power and oxygen rapidly
â–¸ Cabin heat comes from electrical systemsâ€”must shut down to save batteries
â–¸ Temperature in CM will drop to freezing (38Â°F)
â–¸ Lunar Module "Aquarius" designed for 2 people for 2 days
â–¸ Need life support for 3 people for 4+ days

=== OPTION 1: FREEZE ===
Subtitle: Stay in Command Module

PROS:
â€¢ More spacious (~210 cubic feet)
â€¢ Familiar systems and controls
â€¢ Only module with heat shield for re-entry

CONS:
â€¢ No power = no heat, will freeze
â€¢ Limited oxygen remaining
â€¢ No life support systems active
â€¢ Crew will not survive 4 days

=== OPTION 2: SQUEEZE ===
Subtitle: Move to Lunar Module

PROS:
â€¢ Power available from LM batteries
â€¢ Life support systems functional
â€¢ Oxygen reserves sufficient
â€¢ Can survive the journey home

CONS:
â€¢ Extremely cramped (~160 cubic feet)
â€¢ Designed for 2, now holding 3
â€¢ Moving disturbs othersâ€”no sleep
â€¢ Still cold (38Â°F), condensation on walls
â€¢ Power & water very tight

=== DECISION PROMPT ===
ðŸ¤” WHAT SHOULD THE CREW DO?

=== HISTORICAL DECISION ===
NASA chose SQUEEZE into Lunar Module "Aquarius"
â€¢ GET ~56:00:00 - Power down Command Module
â€¢ All three crew moved to LM as lifeboat
â€¢ So crowded that moving arms/legs disturbed others
â€¢ Sleep deprivation became major issue
â€¢ LM kept them alive for the entire journey home
