DECISION POINT #10
COMPUTER RESTART OR MANUAL FLIGHT?
GET 142:40:46 | Final Approachâ€”The Re-Entry Corridor

=== THE SITUATION ===
â–¸ Final approach to Earth's atmosphereâ€”one chance to get it right
â–¸ The Re-entry Corridor: Extremely narrow margin
  â€¢ Target angle: ~-6.5Â° (Apollo 13 aimed for ~-6.2Â°)
  â€¢ Acceptable window: roughly -5.25Â° to -7.4Â° (only ~2Â° margin!)
  â€¢ Too shallow (<-5.25Â°): Skip off atmosphere into spaceâ€”lost forever
  â€¢ Too steep (>-7.4Â°): Burn up from excessive heat and g-forces
â–¸ Guidance computer powered down for 4 days (since GET ~56)
â–¸ CM freezing cold (38-50Â°F) with condensation and ice on walls
â–¸ Computer NOT designed to be turned off and restarted
â–¸ Unknown if frozen computer will restart after days in cold

=== OPTION 1: MANUAL RE-ENTRY ===
Subtitle: Don't risk restarting frozen guidance computer

PROS:
â€¢ Avoids potential computer failure
â€¢ Saves battery power for other systems
â€¢ No risk of restart damaging circuits
â€¢ Crew maintains direct control

CONS:
â€¢ Maintaining precise angle manually nearly impossible
â€¢ Crew exhausted after 6 days of stress and no sleep
â€¢ One small mistake = skip off atmosphere or burn up
â€¢ No computer assistance for rocket adjustments
â€¢ Extremely low probability of success
â€¢ Manual control can't match computer precision

=== OPTION 2: RESTART GUIDANCE COMPUTER ===
Subtitle: Attempt to power up frozen systems

PROS:
â€¢ Computer can automatically maintain precise angle
â€¢ Controls all rocket adjustments with perfect timing
â€¢ Far higher survival probability
â€¢ Computer designed for this (when working properly)
â€¢ Removes human error from most critical phase

CONS:
â€¢ Computer may not restart after days frozen
â€¢ Condensation may have damaged electrical circuits
â€¢ Restart drains critical battery power
â€¢ If startup fails, no time to switch to manual
â€¢ Ice formation could short-circuit systems
â€¢ Never testedâ€”shutdown/restart not in design

=== DECISION PROMPT ===
ðŸ¤” WHAT SHOULD THE CREW DO?

=== HISTORICAL DECISION ===
NASA chose RISK THE COMPUTER RESTART
â€¢ Engineers designed careful power-up sequence
â€¢ Held their breath as frozen computer came online...
â€¢ Success! The guidance computer restarted perfectly!
â€¢ GET 142:40:46 - Entry Interface (400,000 ft altitude)
â€¢ Computer-guided entry kept them in the corridor
â€¢ Entry flight-path angle: ~-6.2Â° (perfectly within safe window!)
â€¢ Splashdown: 12:07:44 PM CST, April 17, 1970
â€¢ Pacific Ocean, near USS Iwo Jima
â€¢ All crew survived
â€¢ Computer performed flawlessly despite never being designed for shutdown/restart
â€¢ A frozen computer saved three lives
