NARRATIVE SLIDE #4
THE LONG COLD JOURNEY
April 15-16, 1970 | Days 5-6, Survival Mode

=== THE MARATHON BEGINS ===
Days 5-6: April 15-16, 1970
Distance from Earth: Closing, but still 100,000+ miles
Time remaining: ~48 hours to splashdown
Status: Alive, barely

=== LIVING CONDITIONS ===
Inside Aquarius - The Freezing Lifeboat:

Temperature: 38°F (3°C)
• Colder than a refrigerator
• Water droplets condensing on walls
• Ice forming on equipment and windows
• Crew shivering uncontrollably
• Can't sleep—too cold, too cramped

Water Rations: 6 oz per day (less than 1 cup)
• Severe dehydration for all crew
• Fred Haise: kidney/urinary infection developing
• Lips cracked, throats parched
• Dizzy from dehydration
• Combined weight loss: 31.5 pounds total

Food: Minimal
• Too cold to eat much
• Stress kills appetite
• Dry food hard to swallow without water
• Crew forcing down calories

Sleep: Nearly impossible
• Cramped quarters—moving wakes others
• Too cold to relax
• Constant stress and worry
• Exhaustion compounding errors

=== THE CO2 CRISIS ===
GET ~90:00:00 - Mailbox Saves Lives

The Problem:
• CO2 rising to dangerous levels (~15 mmHg—deadly)
• LM scrubbers (round) designed for 2 for 2
• Three people breathing for 4+ days
• Headaches, nausea, impaired thinking

The Solution:
• Build "mailbox" adapter from spare parts
• Use CM's square scrubbers in LM's round receptacles
• Materials: duct tape, plastic bags, cardboard, hoses
• Mission Control designs it, crew builds it

The Result:
• CO2 drops from ~14.9 to ~4.6 mmHg
• Breathable air restored
• Crisis averted with duct tape and ingenuity

=== NAVIGATION CHALLENGES ===
GET ~105:18 - Mid-Course Correction

Without computer alignment:
• Use Sun positioned in AOT
• Use Earth's terminator (day/night line) in COAS
• Manual alignment by Jim Lovell
• Small burn: ~7-8 ft/s to fine-tune trajectory
• Targets Pacific splashdown zone

Challenges:
• Debris field still creating "sparklies"
• Manual alignment less precise than computers
• One mistake could miss Earth entirely
• Lovell's skill and experience critical

=== POWER CRISIS ===
GET ~110:00:00 - Radio Silence

Battery Status: Critical
• Running on LM batteries designed for short lunar landing
• Every communication drains power
• Need enough for re-entry computers and parachutes

The Decision: Communication discipline
• Reduce radio contact to essentials only
• Some silence periods last 6+ hours
• Families on Earth terrified
• Mission Control flying blind
• Crew feels abandoned but understands

=== PSYCHOLOGICAL TOLL ===
The Crew:
Jim Lovell (Commander, age 42)
• Fourth spaceflight, most experienced
• Staying calm, making decisions
• Exhausted but focused

Jack Swigert (CMP, age 38)
• First spaceflight
• Flipped the switch that started it all
• Guilt and stress building
• Working through procedures flawlessly

Fred Haise (LMP, age 36)
• First spaceflight
• Developing kidney infection
• In pain, deteriorating
• Pushing through

=== EARTH WATCHES ===
Around the World:
• Families praying for safe return
• Media 24/7 coverage
• Mission Control working in shifts
• Engineers solving problems in real-time
• Public vigils and prayers
• President Nixon promises full rescue efforts

The Stakes:
• If they don't make it, NASA may never recover
• Entire Apollo program at risk
• Three lives hanging in balance
• No rescue mission possible
• One chance to get this right

=== CRITICAL SYSTEMS STATUS ===
GET ~136:00:00 - Approaching Earth

Oxygen: Sufficient (thanks to LM reserves)
Water: Nearly exhausted (cutting it close)
Power: Critical (20% remaining)
CO2: Controlled (mailbox working)
Heat: Non-existent (still 38°F)
Crew Health: Deteriorating but functional

Timeline to Splashdown: ~6 hours

Still to come:
• Battery jump-start (never tested)
• Service Module jettison (first look at damage)
• LM jettison (saying goodbye to lifeboat)
• CM power-up (will frozen computers work?)
• Re-entry (0.5° margin for error)

NEXT: Powering Up & Jettison
