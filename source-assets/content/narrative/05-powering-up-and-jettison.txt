NARRATIVE SLIDE #5
POWERING UP & JETTISON
April 17, 1970 | Final Preparations for Re-Entry

=== THE FINAL COUNTDOWN ===
Day 6 - April 17, 1970
GET ~136:00:00 - 6 hours from splashdown
Status: Alive, approaching Earth
Challenge: Must transition from dead CM to working re-entry spacecraft

=== THE BATTERY PROBLEM ===
GET ~138:00:00 - Jump-Start Procedure

The Situation:
• Command Module batteries at 2% power
• Powered down for 4 days to conserve for re-entry
• Need full power for computers, parachutes, life support
• LM has remaining battery power
• Must transfer power LM → CM

The Risk:
• Procedure NEVER tested before
• Could short-circuit both systems
• Might electrocute crew
• Could lose all remaining power
• One shot to get it right

Houston's Innovation:
• Engineers design brand-new procedure
• Written in real-time for emergency
• Step-by-step power transfer sequence
• Crew follows instructions precisely

The Result:
✅ Connection successful!
✅ Power flows from LM to CM batteries
✅ One battery briefly "drops off the line" but recovers
✅ CM batteries charge to sufficient levels
✅ Re-entry now possible

New procedure added to NASA emergency playbook

=== SERVICE MODULE JETTISON ===
GET 138:02 - First Look at the Damage

The Separation:
• Pyrotechnic bolts fire
• Service Module drifts away
• Crew sees damage for FIRST TIME
• Cameras ready to photograph

What They See:
• Entire 13-foot panel BLOWN OFF
• Massive structural damage visible
• Interior equipment exposed to space
• Wiring and tubing dangling

Jim Lovell: "There's one whole side of that spacecraft missing!"

The Realization:
• Explosion was catastrophic
• They were lucky to survive initial blast
• Right decision to avoid using SPS engine
• Could have exploded during critical burn
• Photos will help investigate cause

Investigation Evidence:
• Oxygen tank #2 completely destroyed
• Panel ripped from Service Module
• Damage much worse than feared
• Proves how close they came to instant death

=== SAYING GOODBYE TO AQUARIUS ===
GET 141:30 - Lunar Module Jettison

The Lifeboat's Final Moments:
• Four days in cramped, freezing quarters
• Aquarius kept three men alive
• Designed for 2 for 2, gave life to 3 for 4
• Now must separate for CM re-entry

CapCom Joe Kerwin:
"Farewell, Aquarius, and we thank you."

The Separation:
• Crew seals tunnel between LM and CM
• Pyrotechnic bolts fire
• Aquarius drifts away into space
• Last view of their lifeboat

Crew Emotions:
• Gratitude for the trusty spacecraft
• Sadness to see it go
• Aquarius will eventually burn up in atmosphere
• Or orbit Earth as space debris
• Either way, its mission is complete

What Aquarius Provided:
✅ Oxygen for breathing (4 days)
✅ Power for systems (limited but sufficient)
✅ Descent engine for course corrections
✅ Life support in freezing conditions
✅ A chance at survival

=== COMMAND MODULE POWER-UP ===
GET ~141:30 - The Critical Restart

The Challenge:
• CM powered down for 4 days
• Frozen at 38°F with condensation and ice
• Guidance computer NOT designed for shutdown/restart
• Will it work after days in cold?

Houston's Procedure:
• Carefully designed power-up sequence
• Written for frozen, damaged spacecraft
• Normal CM startup: 3 hours
• Emergency startup: Must complete in 2 hours
• Every step critical—no room for error

Swigert Executes:
• Following checklist precisely
• Systems coming online one by one
• Heaters, computers, navigation, life support
• Holding breath for guidance computer...

The Moment of Truth:
• Guidance computer powers up
• Screens flicker to life
• Software loads successfully
• Navigation platform aligns
• All systems GO

Success! Frozen computer works!

=== FINAL SYSTEMS CHECK ===
GET 142:00 - Ready for Re-Entry

Command Module Status:
✅ Batteries: Charged and functional
✅ Guidance Computer: Online and aligned
✅ Life Support: Operating
✅ Parachutes: Armed and ready
✅ Heat Shield: Inspected, appears intact
✅ Re-entry Rockets: Tested
✅ Communications: Functional

Crew Status:
• Dehydrated (weight loss: 31.5 lbs combined)
• Exhausted (minimal sleep for 6 days)
• Cold (hypothermia risk)
• Fred Haise: Kidney infection, fever
• But ALIVE and ready

Distance to Entry Interface: ~45 minutes
Re-entry Corridor: 0.5° margin for error
Stakes: Survive or die

=== THE WORLD WATCHES ===
Global Audience:
• Families gathered around TVs
• Mission Control packed with engineers
• Recovery ships positioned in Pacific
• USS Iwo Jima standing by
• Entire world holding breath

One Question:
Will they make it home?

NEXT: Re-Entry & Splashdown
