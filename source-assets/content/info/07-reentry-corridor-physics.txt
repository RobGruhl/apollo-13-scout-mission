INFO SLIDE #7
RE-ENTRY CORRIDOR PHYSICS
The Narrow Path Between Life and Death

=== THE FINAL CHALLENGE ===
After 4 Days of Survival:

One Last Obstacle:
‚Ä¢ Must hit Earth's atmosphere at EXACT angle
‚Ä¢ Window of success: Only ~2¬∞ margin
‚Ä¢ Too shallow = skip off into space forever
‚Ä¢ Too steep = burn up from heat and g-forces
‚Ä¢ No second chance

The Stakes: Get it perfect or die on live TV

=== THE PHYSICS OF RE-ENTRY ===
Why Is It So Hard?

Speed at Entry Interface:
‚Ä¢ Velocity: ~25,000 mph (36,500 feet per second)
‚Ä¢ That's 7 miles per second!
‚Ä¢ Faster than a speeding bullet (√ó20)
‚Ä¢ Kinetic energy must be dissipated

Friction with Atmosphere:
‚Ä¢ Spacecraft rams into air molecules
‚Ä¢ Air compresses (can't move out of way fast enough)
‚Ä¢ Compression creates EXTREME heat
‚Ä¢ Heat shield ablates (burns away) to dissipate energy

The Heat:
‚Ä¢ Peak temperature: ~5,000¬∞F (2,760¬∞C)
‚Ä¢ Hot enough to melt steel
‚Ä¢ Hot enough to vaporize aluminum
‚Ä¢ Heat shield chars and burns away (by design)

G-Forces:
‚Ä¢ Deceleration from 25,000 mph to 0 mph
‚Ä¢ Peak g-force: ~6-7 g's
‚Ä¢ Crew weighs 6√ó normal weight
‚Ä¢ Breathing difficult, vision blurred

=== THE RE-ENTRY CORRIDOR ===
The Narrow Path:

Entry Angle Definition:
‚Ä¢ Measured relative to Earth's horizon
‚Ä¢ Negative angle = downward path
‚Ä¢ Apollo 13 target: ~-6.2¬∞ to -6.5¬∞
‚Ä¢ Acceptable range: -5.25¬∞ to -7.4¬∞

Total Acceptable Window: ~2.15¬∞ margin
(That's narrower than a pencil held at arm's length!)

=== TOO SHALLOW: SKIP OFF ===
If Angle Less Steep Than -5.25¬∞:

What Happens:
1. Spacecraft hits upper atmosphere
2. Not enough air to slow down significantly
3. Spacecraft SKIPS like stone on water
4. Ricochets back into space
5. Insufficient fuel to return
6. Lost in space forever

The Physics:
‚Ä¢ Lift generated by capsule shape
‚Ä¢ Air too thin to capture spacecraft
‚Ä¢ Trajectory bends back upward
‚Ä¢ Escape velocity maintained
‚Ä¢ No way to turn around

The Outcome:
‚ò†Ô∏è Oxygen runs out in hours
‚ò†Ô∏è Crew freezes to death
‚ò†Ô∏è Spacecraft becomes tomb in space
‚ò†Ô∏è Orbits Earth or Sun forever
‚ò†Ô∏è No rescue possible

Historical Close Call:
‚Ä¢ Gemini 8 (1966) nearly skipped
‚Ä¢ Apollo 11 had guidance error (corrected)
‚Ä¢ Margin for error is REAL

=== TOO STEEP: BURN UP ===
If Angle Steeper Than -7.4¬∞:

What Happens:
1. Spacecraft hits atmosphere too steeply
2. Massive air compression instantly
3. Heat shield overheats beyond design
4. G-forces exceed survivable limits
5. Spacecraft breaks apart or burns up

The Physics:
‚Ä¢ Excessive atmospheric density
‚Ä¢ Heat generation exceeds ablation rate
‚Ä¢ Thermal protection fails
‚Ä¢ Structural stress breaks capsule

Heat Shield Failure:
‚Ä¢ Designed for specific heat load
‚Ä¢ Too steep = heat exceeds capacity
‚Ä¢ Shield burns through to cabin
‚Ä¢ Interior exposed to plasma

G-Force Trauma:
‚Ä¢ Peak g's exceed human tolerance
‚Ä¢ Blood pooling in lower body
‚Ä¢ Loss of consciousness (g-LOC)
‚Ä¢ Potential death from g-forces alone

The Outcome:
‚ò†Ô∏è Heat shield fails
‚ò†Ô∏è Cabin burns up (5,000¬∞F plasma)
‚ò†Ô∏è Or g-forces kill crew
‚ò†Ô∏è Or structural breakup
‚ò†Ô∏è Fireball visible from ground

Historical Tragedy:
‚Ä¢ Soyuz 1 (1967) - parachute failure, impact death
‚Ä¢ Soyuz 11 (1971) - cabin depressurization
‚Ä¢ Columbia (2003) - heat shield damage, breakup

=== THE PERFECT ANGLE ===
Target: -6.2¬∞ to -6.5¬∞ (Apollo 13)

What Happens:
‚úÖ Controlled entry into atmosphere
‚úÖ Heat within design limits
‚úÖ G-forces survivable (6-7 g's)
‚úÖ Predictable deceleration path
‚úÖ Parachute deployment altitude reached
‚úÖ Safe splashdown in ocean

The Entry Profile:
1. Entry Interface (400,000 ft / 120 km)
2. Peak heating (200,000 ft / 60 km)
3. Peak g-force (150,000 ft / 45 km)
4. Communication blackout (plasma)
5. Blackout ends (80,000 ft / 24 km)
6. Drogue chutes (24,000 ft / 7 km)
7. Main chutes (10,000 ft / 3 km)
8. Splashdown (sea level)

=== GUIDANCE CONTROL ===
How to Hit the Corridor:

The Guidance Computer:
‚Ä¢ Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC)
‚Ä¢ Calculates trajectory continuously
‚Ä¢ Makes thousands of corrections
‚Ä¢ Fires small thrusters to adjust angle
‚Ä¢ Maintains precise path through corridor

Reaction Control System (RCS):
‚Ä¢ 12 small thrusters on CM
‚Ä¢ Fire in pulses (milliseconds)
‚Ä¢ Adjust pitch, yaw, roll
‚Ä¢ Computer controls automatically

Aerodynamic Lift:
‚Ä¢ CM is NOT symmetric (offset center of gravity)
‚Ä¢ Generates lift like tiny wing
‚Ä¢ Computer uses lift to "steer"
‚Ä¢ Can aim for Pacific landing zone

Manual Backup:
‚Ä¢ Crew can override computer
‚Ä¢ Hand controller for thrusters
‚Ä¢ But nearly impossible to be accurate enough
‚Ä¢ Computer is essential for survival

=== THE APOLLO 13 CHALLENGE ===
Why Re-entry Was Even Harder:

The Frozen Computer:
‚Ä¢ Guidance computer powered down for 4 days
‚Ä¢ Temperature: 38¬∞F (not designed for this)
‚Ä¢ Condensation and ice on circuits
‚Ä¢ NOT designed to shutdown and restart
‚Ä¢ Unknown if it would work

The Risk:
‚Ä¢ If computer fails to restart ‚Üí manual control
‚Ä¢ Manual control ‚Üí low probability of success
‚Ä¢ Exhausted crew after 4 days of hell
‚Ä¢ One chance to get it right

The Decision: Risk the computer restart
‚Ä¢ Engineers designed careful power-up sequence
‚Ä¢ Crew held their breath...
‚Ä¢ Computer restarted! ‚úÖ
‚Ä¢ Systems came online
‚Ä¢ Guidance active

The Execution:
‚Ä¢ Computer controlled re-entry
‚Ä¢ Made thousands of micro-adjustments
‚Ä¢ Kept spacecraft in corridor perfectly
‚Ä¢ Entry angle: -6.2¬∞ (PERFECT!)

=== COMMUNICATION BLACKOUT ===
The Plasma Sheath:

During Re-entry:
‚Ä¢ Heat creates ionized plasma around spacecraft
‚Ä¢ Plasma blocks radio waves
‚Ä¢ All communications CUT OFF
‚Ä¢ Ground has no idea if crew is alive

Expected Blackout: 3-4 minutes

Apollo 13 Blackout: 4 minutes 24 seconds
‚Ä¢ Longer than normal (deeper entry?)
‚Ä¢ Mission Control tense
‚Ä¢ Families terrified
‚Ä¢ World watching

Then: "Okay, Joe." (Swigert's voice)
‚Ä¢ Cheers erupt!
‚Ä¢ They survived!
‚Ä¢ They're coming home!

=== THE PARACHUTES ===
Final Phase:

Parachute Sequence:
1. Drogue Chutes (24,000 ft):
   ‚Ä¢ Two small chutes deploy
   ‚Ä¢ Stabilize spacecraft
   ‚Ä¢ Slow from 300 mph to 175 mph

2. Main Chutes (10,000 ft):
   ‚Ä¢ Three massive orange-and-white chutes
   ‚Ä¢ Each 83 feet diameter
   ‚Ä¢ Slow to 22 mph for splashdown

The Worry:
‚Ä¢ Will parachutes deploy after 4 days frozen?
‚Ä¢ Mechanisms could be frozen
‚Ä¢ Pyrotechnic charges might fail

The Reality:
‚Ä¢ All parachutes deployed perfectly
‚Ä¢ Beautiful sight from TV cameras
‚Ä¢ Three chutes blooming
‚Ä¢ Odyssey descending safely

=== SPLASHDOWN ACCURACY ===
The Target:

Landing Zone:
‚Ä¢ Pacific Ocean
‚Ä¢ Near USS Iwo Jima (recovery ship)
‚Ä¢ Specific coordinates radioed

Apollo 13 Splashdown:
‚Ä¢ Distance from ship: 3.5 miles
‚Ä¢ Essentially perfect!
‚Ä¢ Computer-guided re-entry worked flawlessly
‚Ä¢ Despite frozen restart, manual alignment, damaged systems

The Math:
‚Ä¢ Traveled 240,000+ miles
‚Ä¢ Aimed for target size of small island
‚Ä¢ Hit within 3.5 miles
‚Ä¢ Accuracy: 99.999%

=== THE MIRACLE ===
What Had to Go Right:

‚úÖ Free-return trajectory burn (perfect)
‚úÖ PC+2 speed-up burn (perfect)
‚úÖ Manual navigation using Sun/Earth (worked)
‚úÖ Mid-course corrections (on target)
‚úÖ Battery jump-start (successful)
‚úÖ Frozen computer restart (miraculous)
‚úÖ Guidance system operation (flawless)
‚úÖ Re-entry angle (perfect -6.2¬∞)
‚úÖ Heat shield integrity (held together)
‚úÖ Parachute deployment (all three chutes)
‚úÖ Splashdown accuracy (3.5 miles from ship)

Any ONE failure = death

=== THE NUMBERS ===
Re-entry Statistics:

Entry Velocity: ~25,000 mph
Peak Heat: ~5,000¬∞F
Peak G-Force: 6-7 g's
Blackout Duration: 4 min 24 sec
Entry Angle: -6.2¬∞ (perfect!)
Acceptable Range: -5.25¬∞ to -7.4¬∞
Margin of Error: ¬±1.15¬∞ (less than 2¬∞)
Landing Accuracy: 3.5 miles from target
Crew Survival: 100% ‚úÖ

=== DID YOU KNOW? ===
Re-entry Facts:

‚Ä¢ Heat shield ablates (burns) ~1 inch during re-entry
‚Ä¢ Charred material carries away heat
‚Ä¢ This is BY DESIGN (not a failure)

‚Ä¢ Peak g-forces compress crew into couches
‚Ä¢ Lovell: "It felt like someone sitting on my chest"
‚Ä¢ Training in centrifuge prepared them

‚Ä¢ Plasma blackout creates "ion sheath"
‚Ä¢ Radio waves can't penetrate
‚Ä¢ Like trying to talk through fire

‚Ä¢ Apollo 13's re-entry was nominal (perfect)
‚Ä¢ Despite everything that went wrong before
‚Ä¢ The computer saved their lives

=== THE LESSON ===
Physics doesn't care about your problems.
Hit the corridor or die.

The numbers don't lie:
‚Ä¢ Too shallow: Skip off and float forever
‚Ä¢ Too steep: Burn up in fireball
‚Ä¢ Just right: Live

Precision matters.
Computers save lives.
Math works.

And three men came through fire
To land safely in the ocean.
