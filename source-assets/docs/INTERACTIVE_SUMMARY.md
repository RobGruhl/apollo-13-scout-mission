# Apollo 13 Interactive Branch - Planning Summary

**Date**: October 4, 2025
**Branch**: `interactive-game`
**Status**: âœ… Planning Complete â†’ Ready for Implementation

---

## What We're Building

A lightweight, mobile-friendly web version of the Apollo 13 educational experience that scouts can access via QR code. This complements the physical poster system by providing a self-paced, interactive digital walkthrough.

---

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Hosting: GitHub Pages (Free, Zero Cost)
- **URL**: `https://[username].github.io/apollo-mission/interactive/`
- **Cost**: $0/month (permanent free tier)
- **Bandwidth**: 100GB/month (more than enough)
- **Built-in HTTPS**: âœ…
- **Auto-deployment**: Push to branch â†’ live in 2 minutes

### 2. Technology: Pure Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **No frameworks**: React/Vue not needed, adds complexity
- **No build process**: Simple HTML files, edit and push
- **No dependencies**: Won't break over time
- **Fast loading**: <3 seconds on 3G
- **Works offline**: Can download entire site

### 3. Content Strategy: Simplified from Posters
- **Narrative slides**: 40% of poster content, focus on key events
- **Decision slides**: Full PROS/CONS but fewer bullets (top 3-4)
- **Info slides**: Accordion-style expandable sections
- **Images**: Optimized for web (<100KB each vs original 6.5MB)

### 4. User Experience: Self-Guided Navigation
- **Landing page**: Mission overview + "Start Mission" button
- **Linear mode**: Next/Previous navigation (default)
- **Explore mode**: Timeline view, jump to any moment
- **Decision interactions**: Click option â†’ reveal historical choice
- **Progress tracking**: LocalStorage saves progress

## What Happens Next

### Option 1: Review Planning Documents (Recommended)
Before reorganizing files, review the two planning docs:
1. Read `INTERACTIVE_REQUIREMENTS.md` - Understand what we're building
2. Read `INTERACTIVE_TECHNICAL_PLAN.md` - See how we'll build it
3. Provide feedback or approve
4. Then proceed with implementation

### Option 2: Start Implementation Now
If planning looks good, we can immediately:
1. Reorganize directory structure
2. Create landing page (`interactive/index.html`)
3. Build 3 sample slides (1 narrative, 1 decision, 1 info)
4. Set up GitHub Pages
5. Generate QR code and test

## Questions to Resolve

Before we proceed with reorganization and implementation:

1. **GitHub Account**: What's your GitHub username for Pages URL?
   - Will be: `https://[username].github.io/apollo-mission/interactive/`

2. **Custom Domain** (Optional): Want a custom URL like `apollo13.scoutproject.org`?
   - Not required, GitHub Pages URL works fine
   - Costs ~$12/year if you want one

3. **QR Code Placement**: Where should QR codes go?
   - Handout cards?
   - Bottom corner of physical posters?
   - Both?

4. **Content Reduction**: Comfortable with simplifying poster content for web?
   - Decision slides: Keep all PROS/CONS but reduce to top 3-4 bullets?
   - Narrative slides: ~40% of poster content?
   - Info slides: Expandable accordion sections?

5. **Testing**: Can we get 2-3 scouts to test before full launch?
   - Helps validate UX and find issues

## Comparison: Static Posters vs Interactive Web

| Feature | Static Posters | Interactive Web |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Audience** | Groups of 15, leader-led | Individual, self-guided |
| **Access** | Scout meetings only | Anywhere, anytime via QR |
| **Cost** | $600-1,200 (printing) | $0/month (hosting) |
| **Updates** | Reprint required ($$$) | Edit HTML, instant |
| **Reach** | Limited to physical events | Unlimited, global |
| **Content** | High density, 10-foot viewing | Moderate, screen optimized |
| **Interaction** | Group discussion/voting | Click-through, reveals |
| **Portability** | Transport posters | QR code, URL |
| **Lifespan** | Years (physical degradation) | Permanent (digital archive) |

**Recommendation**: Build both! They complement each other:
- Posters for in-person scout meetings (high engagement)
- Web version for follow-up, sharing, and broader reach

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Images too large (slow loading) | Medium | High | Aggressive compression, WebP format, lazy loading |
| Content too dense for mobile | Low | Medium | Tested responsive design, expandable sections |
| GitHub Pages traffic exceeded | Very Low | Medium | Free tier is 100GB/month (plenty for use case) |
| QR codes don't scan | Low | Medium | Test multiple generators, ensure size/contrast |
| Browser compatibility issues | Low | Low | Use standard HTML/CSS, progressive enhancement |

**Overall Risk**: Low - Static sites are simple, reliable, and well-tested technology
