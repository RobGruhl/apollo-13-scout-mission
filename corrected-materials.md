Apollo 13 Mission Timeline & Key Decision Points

(A Scout-style “choose‑wise‑or‑else” lesson about a real space emergency.)

⸻

Mission Overview (facts to know first)
	•	Crew: Jim Lovell (Commander), Jack Swigert (Command Module Pilot), Fred Haise (Lunar Module Pilot).  ￼
	•	Spacecraft: Command/Service Module (CSM) Odyssey, Lunar Module (LM) Aquarius.  ￼
	•	Launch: April 11, 1970 at 2:13 p.m. EST (1:13 p.m. CST). The Saturn V lifted them to a short Earth parking orbit, then sent them toward the Moon.  ￼
	•	Original Goal: Land at Fra Mauro on the Moon. Outcome: Lunar landing aborted; crew returned safely—NASA calls it a “successful failure.”  ￼

Complete Timeline (GET = Ground Elapsed Time, the mission clock)

Day 1 – Sat, April 11, 1970 (Launch Day)
	•	GET 00:00:00 – Launch.
About 5½ minutes after liftoff, the S‑II (second stage) center engine shut down early because of pogo vibrations. The other four engines burned 34 seconds longer, and the S‑IVB third stage burned 9 seconds longer, so Apollo 13 still reached orbit and then headed for the Moon. Good rocket design saved the day here.  ￼
	•	The crew completed Trans‑Lunar Injection (TLI) and began cruising outward. Early in cruise, a planned correction took them off “free‑return” so they could aim for Fra Mauro.  ￼

Day 2 – Sun, April 12
	•	Routine systems checks and TV from space. Trajectory was NOT free‑return at this point (they would need engine work to come home).  ￼

Day 3 – Mon, April 13 (The Crisis)
	•	GET 55:54:53 – Oxygen tank #2 exploded in the Service Module. Lights flashed, alarms sounded, and power dropped. Swigert radioed, “Houston, we’ve had a problem.” The blast crippled fuel cells (their main power source) and started venting oxygen. The Moon trip instantly turned into a survival mission.  ￼

⸻

DECISION POINT #1 — How do we turn home?

Situation: CSM’s big engine (SPS) might be damaged; fuel cells are failing.
Options Scouts Consider:
	1.	“Turn Around Now” (fire rockets to reverse course).
	•	Sounds fast, but would require a huge burn and a healthy engine they no longer trusted.
	2.	“Go Free‑Return” (use the Moon’s gravity like a slingshot).
	•	Safer and fuel‑light, and it avoids stressing a damaged ship.

What NASA did (and why it’s right):
	•	GET 61:29:42 – Burned the LM’s descent engine (DPS) ~31 seconds to get back onto a free‑return path that would loop behind the Moon and head home. This minimized risk and used the LM, which was undamaged.  ￼

⸻

DECISION POINT #2 — Freeze in the CSM or squeeze into the LM lifeboat?

Situation: The CSM was running out of power and oxygen; its cabin heat came from electrical systems that had to be shut down.
Options:
	1.	Stay in Odyssey (bigger, but dying).
	2.	Move into Aquarius (the LM “lifeboat”). Small and meant for 2 for ~2 days… now needed for 3 people ~4 days.

What NASA did:
	•	Move to the LM and power down the CSM to save its batteries for re‑entry. Oxygen in the LM was sufficient; power and water were the real worries. Inside, it got as cold as 38 °F with condensation on the walls; sleep was hard.  ￼

⸻

DECISION POINT #3 — How do we aim for burns if “stars” are fake?

Problem: The explosion made a cloud of glittering debris (“sparklies”). Through the alignment telescope, that junk looked like stars, so normal star‑sighting alignment was unsafe. A precise burn was coming.
Options:
	1.	Wait hours for debris to clear (risk missing maneuver windows).
	2.	Use big targets: the Sun and the Earth’s day‑night line (terminator) as an emergency alignment.

What NASA did:
	•	“Sun check” passed at GET ~73:46—Lovell and Haise used the Sun in the LM’s AOT and the Earth’s terminator in the COAS to prove the platform was lined up closely enough for the long burn after the Moon. This clever method became a go‑to backup technique.  ￼

⸻

Day 4 – Tue, April 14
	•	Closest approach to the Moon: about 137 nautical miles (≈158 miles / 254 km) above the surface; the spacecraft swung behind the Moon (short comm blackout) and came out headed back to Earth.  ￼

DECISION POINT #4 — CO₂ is climbing. Can we “build a fix”?

Problem: The LM’s LiOH canisters (CO₂ filters) were round and sized for 2 people. The crew had extra square canisters from the CSM—but the shapes didn’t match. CO₂ levels rose into the danger zone.
Options:
	1.	Do nothing but rest (not enough—CO₂ would keep rising).
	2.	Build an adapter from what’s onboard (“the mailbox”).

What NASA did:
	•	Mission Control engineered a square‑to‑round adapter using plastic bags, cardboard, duct tape, and a hose. The crew built it and CO₂ fell from ~14.9 to ~4.6 mmHg—back to safe. Lifesaving ingenuity.  ￼

DECISION POINT #5 — Water: drink it or cool the electronics?

Problem: Water was needed for drinking and for cooling electronics. Supplies were tight.
Options:
	1.	Spread water evenly (everything runs short).
	2.	Prioritize crew drinking.
	3.	Prioritize cooling.

What NASA did:
	•	Extreme rationing. Each astronaut got about 6 oz/day (normal is ~64 oz). They cut cooling to the minimum. The LM still made it; the crew lost a combined 31.5 lb (Lovell 14, Swigert 11, Haise 6.5) and got dehydrated (Haise developed a kidney/urinary infection but recovered).  ￼

DECISION POINT #6 — Speed up or coast? (The “PC+2” burn)

Why: Free‑return would get them home too late and in the wrong ocean. A longer LM burn 2 hours after pericynthion (PC+2) would cut ~9–10 hours and aim for a better recovery area.
Risk: The LM Descent Engine (DPS) would run for several minutes in deep space—within its design, but high‑stakes.
What NASA did:
	•	GET 79:27:40 – PC+2 burn using the LM DPS, about 4½–5 minutes total, roughly ~900 ft/s of delta‑V. This shortened the trip and targeted the Pacific recovery zone.  ￼

⸻

Day 5 – Wed–Thu, April 15–16
	•	The cabin stayed very cold (down to 38–50 °F depending on module). The crew ate little and slept poorly. To save power, they even turned off the high‑power radio amp and used low‑power “Down Voice Backup” when possible—so some comm periods were very quiet.  ￼

DECISION POINT #7 — Talk often or save every watt?

Problem: Radio time costs battery power they must save for re‑entry.
Options:
	1.	Chat on schedule (boost morale, but drains power).
	2.	Radio only when needed (cold silence, but saves power).

What NASA did:
	•	Strict comm discipline. Essential updates only; longer quiet stretches in between. This helped keep enough power for guidance and re‑entry work later.  ￼

DECISION POINT #8 — Can we “jump‑start” Odyssey’s dead batteries from Aquarius?

Problem: The CM batteries needed enough juice for re‑entry, but Odyssey had been cold and dark for days; a normal start‑up procedure didn’t exist.
Options:
	1.	Try to re‑enter on what’s left (too risky).
	2.	Charge CM batteries from the LM (never done before).

What NASA did:
	•	Houston designed a brand‑new power‑up and charge procedure. The crew charged the CM from the LM successfully—one CM battery even briefly “dropped off the line” but recovered. This made re‑entry possible.  ￼

DECISION POINT #9 — When to let the damaged Service Module go?

Problem: They must jettison the SM before re‑entry. Early separation lets them photograph the damage and removes collision risk; later separation keeps extra “shielding” a little longer.
What NASA did:
	•	GET 138:02 – Jettisoned the SM and photographed the wrecked panel. Lovell: “There’s one whole side of that spacecraft missing!” Seeing the damage confirmed they were right to avoid the SPS engine.  ￼

Day 6 – Fri, April 17 (Home Day)
	•	GET 141:30 – Jettisoned LM Aquarius. CapCom Joe Kerwin: “Farewell, Aquarius, and we thank you.” The trusty lifeboat was cut loose.  ￼

DECISION POINT #10 — Re‑entry guidance: trust the computer or fly by hand?

Challenge: The re‑entry corridor is only a few degrees wide (Apollo aimed for about –6.5°, acceptable roughly –5.25° to –7.4°), so precision matters. The CM computer had been frozen and off for days—would it even restart? Manual only would be very hard after 6 tough days.  ￼
What NASA did:
	•	Power‑up succeeded; the guidance computer came back.
	•	GET 142:40:46 – Entry Interface (400,000 ft). Computer‑guided entry kept them in the corridor (entry flight‑path angle ~6.2° for Apollo 13’s final PAD). Splashdown at 12:07:44 p.m. CST near USS Iwo Jima in the Pacific.  ￼

Technical Visuals & “Explain‑It‑Like‑a‑Scout” Notes

Orbital Mechanics (what the burns did):
	•	Free‑return = a path that loops behind the Moon and naturally comes back to Earth.
	•	61:29:42 DPS burn (~31 s) put them back on free‑return right after the accident. PC+2 (~79:27:40) was a long LM burn done two hours after swinging behind the Moon to speed up and target the Pacific recovery area. A small manual mid‑course tweak at ~105:18 (about 7–8 ft/s) used Earth’s day‑night line and the Sun as visual guides.  ￼

Spacecraft spaces & cold:
	•	CSM Odyssey (only ship with heat shield) was shut down early to save power for re‑entry.
	•	LM Aquarius became the lifeboat; it stayed very cold (down to 38–50 °F), with water droplets on the walls.  ￼

CO₂ “Mailbox” parts list:
	•	Square LiOH canisters (from CSM) + plastic bags, cardboard, duct tape, hose = adapter that dropped CO₂ from ~14.9 to ~4.6 mmHg in the LM loop.  ￼

Resources over time (big picture):
	•	Oxygen: OK in the LM; not the main limiter. Power & water were tight. The team reduced energy use to ~1/5 of normal LM operations and still had ~20% of LM electrical power left at LM jettison. Water ration ~6 oz/day/person. Total weight loss: 31.5 lb (Lovell 14, Swigert 11, Haise 6.5).  ￼

Re‑entry corridor:
	•	Think of a narrow downhill path in the sky. Too steep → too hot/too many g‑forces; too shallow → you skip out. Apollo targeted about –6.5°, with an acceptable window roughly –5.25° to –7.4°; Apollo 13’s final PAD showed ~6.20° at Entry Interface—and it worked.  ￼

Mission Statistics (confirmed)
	•	Total Duration: 5 days, 22 hours, 54 minutes, 41 seconds.
	•	Distance Traveled: 622,268 miles.
	•	Closest approach to Moon: ≈158 miles (254 km).
	•	Splashdown: 12:07:44 p.m. CST, April 17, 1970, Pacific Ocean, near USS Iwo Jima.  ￼

Lessons for Scouts (and everyone)
	1.	Redundancy saves lives. The LM became a lifeboat when the CSM failed.  ￼
	2.	Be inventive under pressure. The CO₂ mailbox and Sun/Earth alignment show calm creativity.  ￼
	3.	Teamwork matters. Crew and Mission Control solved problems together, step by step.  ￼
	4.	Discipline wins. Power‑saving comm rules and careful checklists kept enough juice for re‑entry.  ￼
	5.	Design margins help. The LM engine handled long burns; guidance restart worked even after a deep freeze.  ￼

Ready‑to‑Run Activity Script (for your meeting)
	1.	Set the scene (2 min).
“You’re in space, 200,000+ miles from Earth. A tank blew up. Your job is to get home alive.” (Show the damaged Service Module photo.)
	2.	Walk the timeline & pause at each decision (15–20 min).
	•	DP#1: Turn around vs free‑return → pick free‑return (why?)
	•	DP#2: CSM vs LM → pick LM lifeboat (oxygen OK; power & water tight).
	•	DP#3: Stars vs Sun/Earth → pick Sun/Earth alignment.
	•	DP#4: CO₂ → build the mailbox.
	•	DP#5: Water → 6 oz/day, crew first, minimal cooling.
	•	DP#6: PC+2 burn → speed up to the Pacific.
	•	DP#7: Comms → low‑power check‑ins only.
	•	DP#8: Batteries → charge CM from LM.
	•	DP#9: SM jettison timing → early enough to inspect damage.
	•	DP#10: Re‑entry → trust the computer (after the careful restart).
	3.	Hands‑on mini‑build (10 min).
Give patrols a square box, a round tube, tape, a bag, and a card back—ask them to make a “mailbox adapter” that seals. (Compare to the real fix.)  ￼
	4.	Wrap‑up (2 min).
“Calm minds, clear checklists, and teamwork can solve scary problems.”
