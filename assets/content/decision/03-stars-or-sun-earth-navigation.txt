DECISION POINT #3
STARS OR SUN/EARTH NAVIGATION?
GET ~79:27:38 | Lost in Space

=== THE SITUATION ===
â–¸ Need to align spacecraft navigation platform for accurate course corrections
â–¸ Normal method: sight on known stars using alignment telescope (AOT)
â–¸ Problem: Explosion created debris fieldâ€”"sparklies" everywhere
â–¸ Through telescope, debris looks identical to stars
â–¸ Impossible to determine which points of light are real stars
â–¸ Without proper alignment, can't aim precisely for Earth

=== OPTION 1: STAR SIGHTING ===
Subtitle: Use alignment telescope to sight on stars

PROS:
â€¢ Most accurate navigation method available
â€¢ Standard Apollo procedure (proven technique)
â€¢ Provides precise platform orientation
â€¢ Computer can calculate exact trajectory

CONS:
â€¢ Debris field makes stars invisible
â€¢ Cannot distinguish sparklies from real stars
â€¢ Multiple false sightings likely
â€¢ Could misalign platform completely
â€¢ Time-consuming trial and error

=== OPTION 2: SUN/EARTH TERMINATOR ===
Subtitle: Manually align using Sun in AOT + Earth edge in COAS

PROS:
â€¢ Sun is unmistakable (brightest object)
â€¢ Earth terminator (day/night line) clearly visible
â€¢ No confusion with debris
â€¢ Faster than searching for stars
â€¢ "Good enough" accuracy for course corrections

CONS:
â€¢ Less precise than star alignment
â€¢ Manual alignment is tricky
â€¢ Requires simultaneous viewing through two instruments
â€¢ Small errors could compound over distance
â€¢ Not the "approved" NASA procedure

=== DECISION PROMPT ===
ðŸ¤” WHAT SHOULD THE CREW DO?

=== HISTORICAL DECISION ===
NASA chose SUN/EARTH TERMINATOR method
â€¢ GET ~79:27:38 - Manual alignment procedure
â€¢ Sun positioned in AOT (Alignment Optical Telescope)
â€¢ Earth terminator (day/night line) centered in COAS (Crew Optical Alignment Sight)
â€¢ Jim Lovell performed delicate manual alignment
â€¢ "Good enough" accuracy achieved for safe trajectory
â€¢ Proved that improvisation and manual skill beat perfect equipment
