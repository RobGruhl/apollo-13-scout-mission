DECISION POINT #4
BUILD THE CO2 MAILBOX?
GET ~90:00:00 | Rising Carbon Dioxide Crisis

=== THE SITUATION ===
â–¸ CO2 levels rising dangerously in the LM (approaching ~15 mmHgâ€”deadly)
â–¸ LM's lithium hydroxide (LiOH) canisters are ROUND, sized for 2 people for 2 days
â–¸ Now supporting 3 people for ~4 daysâ€”LM scrubbers running out of capacity
â–¸ Command Module has extra SQUARE LiOH canisters (unused)
â–¸ Problem: Square canisters won't fit in round LM receptacles
â–¸ Available materials: plastic bags, cardboard, duct tape, hoses, flight manual covers

=== OPTION 1: DO NOTHING BUT REST ===
Subtitle: Reduce physical activity to slow CO2 production

PROS:
â€¢ Uses existing systemsâ€”no construction needed
â€¢ No risk of adapter failure
â€¢ Conserves energy for crew
â€¢ Simple approach

CONS:
â€¢ Not enoughâ€”CO2 will still keep rising to deadly levels
â€¢ High CO2 impairs judgment and decision-making
â€¢ Could lose consciousness before realizing danger
â€¢ Death by CO2 poisoning within hours
â€¢ No backup plan if this fails

=== OPTION 2: BUILD "MAILBOX" ADAPTER ===
Subtitle: Create square-to-round adapter using onboard materials

PROS:
â€¢ Uses CM's fresh square lithium hydroxide canisters
â€¢ Can sustain 3 people for entire journey
â€¢ Only solution that actually removes CO2
â€¢ Materials are available on board

CONS:
â€¢ Never attempted beforeâ€”completely improvised
â€¢ Uncertain if materials will seal properly
â€¢ Duct tape and plastic might not hold vacuum
â€¢ Failure means deathâ€”no second chance
â€¢ Requires precision assembly in zero-g

=== DECISION PROMPT ===
ðŸ¤” WHAT SHOULD THE CREW DO?

=== HISTORICAL DECISION ===
NASA chose BUILD THE MAILBOX
â€¢ Mission Control engineers designed solution using only materials aboard
â€¢ Crew built adapter using:
  - Square CM lithium hydroxide canisters
  - Plastic bags
  - Cardboard from flight manual covers
  - Duct tape (lots of it!)
  - Hoses
â€¢ CO2 dropped from ~14.9 mmHg to ~4.6 mmHgâ€”back to safe levels
â€¢ Lifesaving ingenuityâ€”solution saved crew's lives
â€¢ Proved that "duct tape fixes everything," even in space
