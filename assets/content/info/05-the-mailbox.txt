THE MAILBOX
Duct Tape, Cardboard, and Genius

=== THE CO2 CRISIS ===
The Problem:

Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Levels Rising:
‚Ä¢ Humans exhale CO2 with every breath
‚Ä¢ In sealed spacecraft, CO2 accumulates
‚Ä¢ High CO2 = headaches, nausea, unconsciousness, death
‚Ä¢ Deadly level: ~15 mmHg partial pressure
‚Ä¢ Apollo 13 approaching ~15 mmHg

The Numbers:
‚Ä¢ LM designed for: 2 people for 45 hours
‚Ä¢ Apollo 13 reality: 3 people for 87+ hours
‚Ä¢ That's 2.9x the CO2 production!

Symptoms of High CO2:
‚Ä¢ Headaches
‚Ä¢ Dizziness
‚Ä¢ Difficulty breathing
‚Ä¢ Impaired judgment
‚Ä¢ Unconsciousness
‚Ä¢ Death

Time to Crisis: Hours, not days

=== THE SCRUBBER MISMATCH ===
How CO2 Scrubbers Work:

Lithium Hydroxide (LiOH) Canisters:
‚Ä¢ Chemical that absorbs CO2 from air
‚Ä¢ Air blown through canister
‚Ä¢ CO2 chemically binds to LiOH
‚Ä¢ Clean air comes out
‚Ä¢ Eventually saturates (must replace)

The Shape Problem:
‚Ä¢ LM canisters: ROUND (cylindrical)
‚Ä¢ CM canisters: SQUARE (rectangular)
‚Ä¢ Different sizes, different connections
‚Ä¢ NOT interchangeable by design

The Inventory:
‚Ä¢ LM has: Limited round canisters (running out)
‚Ä¢ CM has: Plenty of fresh square canisters (unused)
‚Ä¢ Problem: Square peg won't fit in round hole

The Cruel Irony:
‚Ä¢ Plenty of fresh scrubbers on board
‚Ä¢ Just can't use them
‚Ä¢ Like having food you can't open
‚Ä¢ Crew could suffocate with solution 10 feet away

=== THE MISSION CONTROL SCRAMBLE ===
GET ~90:00:00 - Engineers Attack the Problem

The Challenge to Engineers:
"We've got to find a way to make THIS..."
[holds up square CM canister]
"...fit into the hole for THIS..."
[holds up round LM canister]
"...using nothing but THAT."
[dumps out materials available on spacecraft]

Available Materials on Apollo 13:
‚úÖ Plastic bags (food storage)
‚úÖ Cardboard (from flight manual covers)
‚úÖ Duct tape (gray tape, lots of it)
‚úÖ Hoses (from LM systems)
‚úÖ Suit hoses (from spacesuits)
‚úÖ Towels
‚úÖ Bungee cords

NOT Available:
‚ùå Special tools
‚ùå Glue or sealants
‚ùå 3D printer
‚ùå Machine shop
‚ùå Hardware store

The Engineering Team:
‚Ä¢ Work around the clock
‚Ä¢ Build prototype on ground using EXACT same materials
‚Ä¢ Test for air leaks
‚Ä¢ Design step-by-step instructions
‚Ä¢ Must work in zero gravity
‚Ä¢ Must work first time - no second chance

=== THE MAILBOX DESIGN ===
The Concept: Force Air Through Square Canister

Components:
1. Square CM lithium hydroxide canister (the filter)
2. Plastic bag (sealed chamber around canister)
3. Cardboard (structural support and air ducting)
4. Duct tape (seals everything together)
5. Hose (connects to LM air circulation system)

How It Works:
1. Seal square canister inside plastic bag
2. Cut hole in plastic bag for air inlet
3. Attach hose to bag for air outlet
4. Use cardboard to create air duct
5. Tape everything together (LOTS of tape)
6. Connect to LM's air circulation fan
7. Fan pulls air through makeshift scrubber
8. Clean air returns to cabin

Why "Mailbox"?
‚Ä¢ Shape looked like rural mailbox
‚Ä¢ Square opening with connection on side
‚Ä¢ Nickname stuck

=== THE BUILD PROCEDURE ===
Mission Control Radioed Instructions:

Step 1: Gather Materials
"Okay, we need you to find the following items..."
‚Ä¢ 2 square LiOH canisters from CM stowage
‚Ä¢ Large plastic bag
‚Ä¢ Flight manual cover (cardboard)
‚Ä¢ Duct tape roll
‚Ä¢ Suit hose

Step 2: Prepare the Canister
‚Ä¢ Place square canister in plastic bag
‚Ä¢ Position canister for air flow
‚Ä¢ Ensure proper orientation

Step 3: Create Air Path
‚Ä¢ Cut hole in plastic bag
‚Ä¢ Insert hose into hole
‚Ä¢ Seal around hose with tape

Step 4: Cardboard Support
‚Ä¢ Cut cardboard from manual cover
‚Ä¢ Create duct for air flow
‚Ä¢ Tape to bag structure

Step 5: Seal Everything
‚Ä¢ Duct tape around all seams
‚Ä¢ Check for air leaks
‚Ä¢ Reinforce connections
‚Ä¢ Use MORE tape (can't have too much!)

Step 6: Connect to LM System
‚Ä¢ Attach hose to LM air circulation
‚Ä¢ Position mailbox securely
‚Ä¢ Turn on circulation fan

Step 7: Monitor CO2 Levels
‚Ä¢ Watch gauges anxiously
‚Ä¢ Wait for CO2 to drop
‚Ä¢ Pray it works

Build Time: ~1 hour of careful assembly

=== THE RESULT ===
Moment of Truth:

CO2 Level Before Mailbox: ~14.9 mmHg (near-deadly)
CO2 Level After Mailbox: ~4.6 mmHg (safe!)

Drop: 10.3 mmHg in minutes
Time to Safe Levels: Less than 1 hour
Success Rate: 100%

The Crew's Reaction:
‚Ä¢ Relief and amazement
‚Ä¢ Headaches clearing
‚Ä¢ Breathing easier
‚Ä¢ Crisis averted

Jim Lovell: "We have a mailbox!"

=== THE MATERIALS BREAKDOWN ===
What Each Component Did:

Plastic Bag:
‚Ä¢ Created sealed chamber
‚Ä¢ Forced air through canister
‚Ä¢ Prevented leaks to space

Cardboard:
‚Ä¢ Structural support
‚Ä¢ Directed air flow
‚Ä¢ Lightweight and available

Duct Tape:
‚Ä¢ Sealed all connections
‚Ä¢ Held assembly together
‚Ä¢ Airtight seal
‚Ä¢ The real hero of Apollo 13

Hose:
‚Ä¢ Connected mailbox to LM fan
‚Ä¢ Carried clean air back to cabin
‚Ä¢ Flexible for positioning

Square Canister:
‚Ä¢ Fresh lithium hydroxide
‚Ä¢ Absorbed CO2 from air
‚Ä¢ Plenty available in CM

=== WHY IT WORKED ===
Engineering Principles:

Pressure Differential:
‚Ä¢ LM fan creates suction
‚Ä¢ Pulls air through mailbox
‚Ä¢ Forces air through LiOH canister
‚Ä¢ Returns clean air to cabin

Seal Integrity:
‚Ä¢ Duct tape creates airtight seal
‚Ä¢ Plastic bag contains air flow
‚Ä¢ No leaks to space (vacuum outside)

Chemical Process:
‚Ä¢ LiOH + CO2 ‚Üí Lithium Carbonate
‚Ä¢ Chemical reaction absorbs CO2
‚Ä¢ Process works regardless of canister shape
‚Ä¢ Just need air to flow through

Human Ingenuity:
‚Ä¢ Problem-solving under pressure
‚Ä¢ Using what's available
‚Ä¢ Testing before execution
‚Ä¢ Clear communication Earth ‚Üî Space

=== THE LEGACY ===
What the Mailbox Represented:

üß† Intelligence:
‚Ä¢ Engineers solved impossible problem
‚Ä¢ Used only materials on board
‚Ä¢ Designed in hours, not months

ü§ù Teamwork:
‚Ä¢ Mission Control designed
‚Ä¢ Crew built
‚Ä¢ Perfect coordination
‚Ä¢ Trust between Earth and space

üõ†Ô∏è Ingenuity:
‚Ä¢ No fancy equipment needed
‚Ä¢ Duct tape and cardboard
‚Ä¢ Sometimes simple is best
‚Ä¢ "Work with what you have"

‚è±Ô∏è Speed:
‚Ä¢ CO2 rising fast
‚Ä¢ Designed solution in hours
‚Ä¢ Built in ~1 hour
‚Ä¢ Worked immediately

=== DUCT TAPE IN SPACE ===
The Universal Fix:

Why Duct Tape Works in Space:
‚úÖ Adhesive works in vacuum
‚úÖ Strong and flexible
‚úÖ Airtight seal
‚úÖ Easy to use in zero gravity
‚úÖ Doesn't outgas (release chemicals)

Apollo 13 Duct Tape Uses:
‚Ä¢ Sealed mailbox adapter
‚Ä¢ Repaired other systems
‚Ä¢ Held equipment in place
‚Ä¢ Temporary fixes everywhere

Every Mission After:
‚Ä¢ Extra duct tape added to manifest
‚Ä¢ "If duct tape can't fix it, nothing can"

=== DID YOU KNOW? ===
Mailbox Facts:

‚Ä¢ Original ground prototype is in Smithsonian museum
‚Ä¢ Actual flight mailbox burned up during re-entry (in LM)
‚Ä¢ Procedure added to all future Apollo missions
‚Ä¢ Inspired MacGyver TV show decades later

‚Ä¢ CO2 stayed at safe levels for entire journey home
‚Ä¢ Second mailbox built as backup (never needed)

‚Ä¢ The square/round mismatch was known before flight
‚Ä¢ But nobody thought LM would be lifeboat for 4 days
‚Ä¢ Design assumption: LM used for 45 hours max

=== THE LESSON ===
When perfect solutions aren't available,
Improvise with what you have.

When fancy equipment fails,
Use duct tape and cardboard.

When time is running out,
Stay calm and work the problem.

When CO2 is killing you,
Build a mailbox.
