‚Ä¢ Width: 31 feet (diagonal across legs)
‚Ä¢ Crew Area: ~160 cubic feet (standing room only)
‚Ä¢ Weight: ~33,000 lbs (fully loaded)

Two Stages:
1. Descent Stage (bottom):
   ‚Ä¢ Landing legs and engine
   ‚Ä¢ Descent Propulsion System (DPS)
   ‚Ä¢ Fuel tanks
   ‚Ä¢ Equipment storage
   ‚Ä¢ Stays on Moon after landing

2. Ascent Stage (top):
   ‚Ä¢ Crew cabin (cramped!)
   ‚Ä¢ Ascent engine
   ‚Ä¢ Life support
   ‚Ä¢ Returns to orbit

Crew Cabin Layout:
‚Ä¢ NO SEATS - designed for standing only
‚Ä¢ Two triangular windows (for landing visibility)
‚Ä¢ Controls and displays on instrument panel
‚Ä¢ Designed for 2 astronauts for 45 hours (Moon landing mission)

What It Provides:
‚úÖ Independent oxygen supply
‚úÖ Battery power (separate from CM/SM)
‚úÖ Descent engine for course corrections
‚úÖ Life support systems
‚úÖ Water cooling for electronics
‚úÖ Communications (backup)

LM Systems:
‚Ä¢ Oxygen: Stored for 2 people for 2 days
‚Ä¢ Power: Batteries for 45-hour lunar mission
‚Ä¢ Water: For cooling and drinking
‚Ä¢ CO2 Scrubbers: ROUND lithium hydroxide canisters

Apollo 13 Lifeboat Role:
‚úÖ Supported 3 people for 4+ days (beyond design!)
‚úÖ Provided all oxygen and power
‚úÖ Descent engine made all course corrections
‚úÖ Kept crew alive in freezing conditions
‚úÖ Cramped but functional

The Squeeze:
‚Ä¢ Designed: 2 people, 45 hours
‚Ä¢ Reality: 3 people, 87+ hours
‚Ä¢ Temperature: 38¬∞F (freezing)
‚Ä¢ Condensation everywhere
‚Ä¢ No sleep possible
‚Ä¢ But it worked!

=== HOW THEY CONNECT ===
The Docking System:

Launch Configuration:
1. Command Module (top/nose)
2. Service Module (middle - attached to CM)
3. Lunar Module (stored in adapter - below SM)
4. Saturn V rocket (bottom - propulsion)

After Launch:
1. CM/SM separate from Saturn V
2. CM/SM turn around (180¬∞ rotation)
3. CM docks with LM nose-to-nose
4. LM extracted from adapter
5. Combined spacecraft flies to Moon

Docking Tunnel:
‚Ä¢ Connects CM to LM
‚Ä¢ 32 inches diameter
‚Ä¢ Crew crawls through in zero gravity
‚Ä¢ Sealed with hatch on each end

Apollo 13 Configuration:
‚Ä¢ CM "Odyssey" + SM (damaged) + LM "Aquarius"
‚Ä¢ All three modules connected
‚Ä¢ Crew used tunnel to move between CM and LM
‚Ä¢ LM became primary habitat
‚Ä¢ CM powered down but still attached
‚Ä¢ SM provided structural support (until jettison)

=== JETTISON SEQUENCE (RE-ENTRY) ===
Step 1 - Service Module Jettison (GET 138:02):
‚Ä¢ SM separated from CM
‚Ä¢ Drifts away into space
‚Ä¢ First view of massive damage
‚Ä¢ CM now exposed

Step 2 - Lunar Module Jettison (GET 141:30):
‚Ä¢ Tunnel sealed
‚Ä¢ LM separated from CM
‚Ä¢ "Farewell, Aquarius, and we thank you"
‚Ä¢ CM alone for re-entry

Step 3 - Re-Entry (GET 142:40:46):
‚Ä¢ CM only module with heat shield
‚Ä¢ Parachutes deploy from CM
‚Ä¢ CM lands in ocean
‚Ä¢ SM and LM burn up in atmosphere (eventually)

=== SYSTEMS COMPARISON ===
| System        | CM           | SM           | LM           |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Crew Capacity | 3 seated     | 0 (unmanned) | 2 standing   |
| Volume        | ~210 cu ft   | N/A          | ~160 cu ft   |
| Power         | Batteries    | Fuel cells   | Batteries    |
| Main Engine   | Small RCS    | SPS (big!)   | DPS + APS    |
| Life Support  | Shared w/SM  | Provides O2  | Independent  |
| Re-entry      | YES ‚úÖ       | NO (burns)   | NO (burns)   |

=== WHY THREE MODULES? ===
Specialization:
‚Ä¢ CM: Optimized for re-entry (heat shield, aerodynamics)
‚Ä¢ SM: Power and propulsion workhorse (fuel cells, main engine)
‚Ä¢ LM: Moon landing specialist (lightweight, landing legs)

Weight Savings:
‚Ä¢ Don't carry landing legs to Earth
‚Ä¢ Don't carry heavy SM through atmosphere
‚Ä¢ Shed weight at each stage

Redundancy:
‚Ä¢ LM has independent systems (backup!)
‚Ä¢ Separate power sources
‚Ä¢ Multiple oxygen supplies
‚Ä¢ This redundancy saved Apollo 13

=== THE LESSON ===
Three modules, three purposes.
One explosion, one lifeboat.

The LM wasn't supposed to save lives in space.
It was supposed to land on the Moon.

But when Odyssey failed, Aquarius stepped up.

A spacecraft designed for 2 for 2 days
Kept 3 men alive for 4+ days.

Engineering redundancy saved three lives.

üöÄ CM + SM + LM = HOME üè†
