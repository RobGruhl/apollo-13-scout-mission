NARRATIVE SLIDE #2
THE EXPLOSION
April 13, 1970 | "Houston, we've had a problem"

=== THE SETUP ===
Day 3 - April 13, 1970
GET 55:54:53 (~9:08 PM Houston time)
Distance from Earth: ~200,000 miles
Speed: ~24,000 mph (traveling away from Earth)
Status: All systems normal, routine evening

=== THE ROUTINE REQUEST ===
Mission Control to Jack Swigert:
"We'd like you to stir up your cryo tanks"

Standard procedure:
• Stir oxygen tanks to get accurate readings
• Oxygen stored as supercold liquid
• Fans stir tanks to prevent stratification
• Done dozens of times on previous missions
• Should take 10 seconds...

=== 55:54:53 - BANG ===
Swigert flips the switch...

LOUD BANG
Spacecraft shakes violently
Master alarm sounds
Warning lights everywhere
Crew feels the ship lurch

Jack Swigert: "Okay, Houston, we've had a problem here"
Houston: "Say again please"
Jim Lovell: "Houston, we've had a problem"

=== WHAT THEY SAW ===
Through the window:
• "Sparklies" - glittering debris field
• Venting gas creating cloud around spacecraft
• Something is catastrophically wrong
• Oxygen pouring into space

On the instruments:
• Oxygen tank 2 pressure: ZERO
• Oxygen tank 1 pressure: FALLING
• Two fuel cells offline
• Main bus B voltage dropping
• Warning lights cascading

Lovell: "We are venting something out into space"

=== THE DAMAGE (Unknown at the time) ===
What actually happened:
• Oxygen tank #2 exploded in Service Module
• Entire 13-foot panel blown off spacecraft
• Damaged oxygen tank #1 (now leaking)
• Fuel cells failing (need oxygen to generate power)
• Service module crippled
• Main engine (SPS) unsafe to use

Crew won't see the damage until SM jettison (GET 138:02)

=== THE CRISIS UNFOLDS ===
Immediate problems:
• Losing oxygen rapidly (need it to breathe)
• Losing power (fuel cells dying)
• Losing main engine (can't thrust home directly)
• 200,000 miles from Earth
• Traveling AWAY from home at 24,000 mph
• Command Module will be dead in hours

Mission Control realizes:
• Moon landing: IMPOSSIBLE
• Normal return: IMPOSSIBLE
• Crew survival: UNCERTAIN

Gene Kranz (Flight Director):
"Okay, let's everybody keep cool. Let's solve the problem, but let's not make it any worse by guessing."

=== WHAT'S AT STAKE ===
The math is brutal:
• 3 astronauts
• 200,000 miles from Earth
• Crippled spacecraft
• Limited oxygen, power, water
• 4+ days to get home
• Margin for error: ZERO

This is now a survival mission.

NEXT DECISION: Turn Around or Free-Return?
