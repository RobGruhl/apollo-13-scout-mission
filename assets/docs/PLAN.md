**Last Updated**: October 3, 2025
**Project Status**: Prototype Optimized ‚úÖ | Font Sizing Complete ‚úÖ | Production Phase Ready
**Client**: Ed (Boy Scout Apollo 13 Program)

---

## üìã Project Overview

### Mission
Create 24 large-format educational posters (3' x 2', landscape) for Boy Scout interactive Apollo 13 presentation. Scouts learn mission timeline and make life-or-death decisions at 10 key crisis points.

### Target Audience
- Boy Scouts (ages 11-17)
- Groups of ~15 scouts per session
- Viewing distance: 6-10 feet from posters

### Key Requirements
- **Readable from 10 feet** - "Cluttered and readable beats pretty with white space" (Ed's directive)
- **Three poster types**: Narrative, Information, Decision
- **Consistent visual design** across all 24 posters
- **Print quality**: 36" x 24" at professional print shop standards

---

## ‚úÖ What We've Accomplished

### 1. Research & Content Development

**Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Gathered authoritative NASA source material
- ‚úÖ Created `corrected-materials.md` with verified facts (GET timestamps, measurements, technical details)
- ‚úÖ Developed `MISSION_TIMELINE.md` with complete mission chronology and 10 decision points
- ‚úÖ Identified all 24 required slides (6 narrative, 10 decision, 8 info)

**Key Corrections Made**:
- Explosion time: GET 55:54:53 (verified)
- Navigation: Sun in AOT + Earth terminator in COAS (not quadrants)
- CO2 levels: 14.9 ‚Üí 4.6 mmHg (correct units)
- Re-entry corridor: -6.5¬∞ target, -5.25¬∞ to -7.4¬∞ acceptable
- LM scrubbers ROUND, CM scrubbers SQUARE (not the reverse)

### 2. Design System & Documentation

**Completed**:
- ‚úÖ `PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md` - Comprehensive PRD with all specifications
- ‚úÖ `TECHNICAL_SOLUTION.md` - One-page technical summary
- ‚úÖ `DIAGRAM_CONCEPTS.md` - 8 large-format diagram concepts with implementation details
- ‚úÖ Design system established:
  - Color palette: NASA Blue (#0B3D91), Cyan (#00ACC1), Warning Yellow (#FFA000), Success Green (#2E7D32), Crisis Red (#DC143C)
  - Typography: Helvetica Neue, large sizes for 10-foot readability
  - Layout grid: 3600px √ó 2400px canvas (3:2 aspect ratio)

### 3. Technical Architecture

**Technology Stack Selected**:
- ‚úÖ **HTML/CSS + inline SVG** (best solution for vector graphics + text)
- ‚úÖ **Browser print to PDF** for production (vector-perfect quality)
- ‚úÖ **Playwright** for automated screenshots (optional PNG export)

**Why This Works**:
- Vector graphics scale infinitely - sharp at any size
- Can preview exactly what will print
- Single CSS file controls all 24 posters (consistency)
- No expensive design software required
- Claude Code can generate complete files natively

### 4. Prototype Poster Optimized! üéâ

**File**: `/Users/robgruhl/Projects/apollo-mission/posters/02-decision-freeze-or-squeeze.html`

**What It Includes**:
- ‚úÖ Decision Point #2: "FREEZE OR SQUEEZE?"
- ‚úÖ **Optimized typography** prioritizing critical content (57px PROS/CONS bullets)
- ‚úÖ Yellow context box with 5 situation bullets
- ‚úÖ **Side-by-side layout breakthrough**:
  - Left: Spacecraft diagrams (40% width)
  - Right: PROS/CONS lists (60% width)
  - Perfect fit: 2401px height (essentially zero overflow)
- ‚úÖ Two option panels with:
  - PROS (green checkmarks, 60px labels)
  - CONS (red X marks, 60px labels)
  - Numbered badges (1 and 2)
- ‚úÖ **Spacecraft diagrams** (inline SVG):
  - Command Module: Cone shape with 3 spaced seats (~210 cu ft)
  - Lunar Module: Narrow box with 3 stick figures crammed together (~160 cu ft)
- ‚úÖ Bold decision prompt: "ü§î WHAT SHOULD THE CREW DO?"
- ‚úÖ Footer with mission dates and branding

**Layout Innovation**:
The side-by-side arrangement of diagrams and PROS/CONS lists was the key breakthrough - it eliminated wasted horizontal space and allowed for 14% larger bullet fonts (50px ‚Üí 57px) while maintaining perfect vertical fit within the 2400px canvas.

**Design Iterations**:
- Version 1: Fonts too small, too much white space ‚ùå
- Version 2: Increased all fonts 30-50%, tighter spacing ‚úÖ
- Version 3: Added spacecraft interior diagrams ‚úÖ
- Version 4: Side-by-side layout (diagrams 40% + PROS/CONS 60%) ‚úÖ
- Version 5: Optimized bullet fonts from 50px ‚Üí 57px (14% increase) ‚úÖ FINAL

**Key Screenshots** (intermediate versions removed):
- V1: `.playwright-mcp/page-2025-10-04T02-56-52-712Z.png` (initial version, 978KB)
- V4: `.playwright-mcp/side-by-side-final.png` (side-by-side breakthrough, 1.3MB)
- V5: `.playwright-mcp/final-optimized-57px-bullets.png` ‚≠ê CURRENT (perfect fit: 2401px, 1.3MB)

| Decision Prompt | 78px | 900 | "WHAT SHOULD THE CREW DO?" |
| Footer | 42-50px | 600-900 | Mission dates, branding |

**Key Optimization**: PROS/CONS bullets increased from 50px to 57px (14% increase) - maximizes readability of most critical decision-making content while maintaining perfect fit (2401px height).

### Color Usage (Established)
- **NASA Blue** (#0B3D91): Headers, branding, decision prompt background
- **Cyan** (#00ACC1): Option badges, borders, neutral accent
- **Yellow** (#FFA000): Warning context box, situation alerts
- **Green** (#2E7D32): PROS bullets and checkmarks
- **Red** (#DC143C): CONS bullets and X marks, danger indicators

### Viewing Distance Calculation
**For testing readability**:
- 36" poster at 10 feet = MacBook 14" (12.3" screen) at 3.5 feet
- Formula: `Laptop distance = (Poster distance) √∑ (Poster width √∑ Screen width)`
- Result: 120" √∑ 2.93 = **~42 inches** (3.5 feet)
