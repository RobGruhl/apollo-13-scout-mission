## Complete Timeline with Ground Elapsed Time (GET)

*Note: GET (Ground Elapsed Time) is the mission clock starting from launch at GET 00:00:00*

### Day 1 - April 11, 1970 (Launch Day)
- **GET 00:00:00** - Launch from Kennedy Space Center
- **GET ~00:05:30** - S-II (second stage) center engine shut down early due to pogo vibrations
  - Other four engines burned 34 seconds longer
  - S-IVB third stage burned 9 seconds longer
  - Apollo 13 still reached orbit and headed for the Moon - good rocket design saved the day
- Trans-Lunar Injection (TLI) completed
- Early in cruise, a planned correction took them off "free-return" to aim for Fra Mauro

### Day 2 - April 12, 1970
- Routine systems checks and TV broadcast from space
- Trajectory was **NOT free-return** at this point (would need engine work to come home)

### Day 3 - April 13, 1970 (The Crisis)
- **GET 55:54:53** - **OXYGEN TANK EXPLOSION**
  - ~200,000 miles from Earth
  - Jack Swigert: "Houston, we've had a problem"
  - Service module oxygen tank #2 explodes
  - Venting creates debris field around spacecraft ("sparklies")
  - Fuel cells fail, losing primary power
  - Command module losing oxygen

---

## DECISION POINT #1: Turn Around or Free-Return Orbit?

**Context**:
- Currently traveling ~24,000 mph away from Earth
- Service module damaged, CM rocket uncertain
- Fuel cells offline, running on batteries

**Options**:
1. **Turn Around**: Blast retrograde to stop, reverse direction
   - PRO: Fastest route home
   - CON: Requires massive fuel, risks explosion of damaged systems, burns through all LM fuel

2. **Free-Return Trajectory**: Use Moon's gravity to slingshot back to Earth
   - PRO: Safer, uses less fuel, proven orbital mechanics
   - CON: Takes longer, must wait to loop around Moon

**Historical Decision**: Free-return trajectory chosen
- **GET 61:29:42** - DPS burn (~31 seconds using LM descent engine)
- Put them back on free-return path that loops behind Moon and heads home
- Safer, uses less fuel, avoids stressing damaged systems
- Used the undamaged LM engine instead of risky CSM engine

---

## DECISION POINT #2: Freeze or Squeeze?

**Context**:
- Command Module losing power and heat rapidly
- Temperature dropping toward 38°F
- Lunar Module designed for 2 people for 2 days
- Need to support 3 people for 4+ days

**Options**:
1. **Freeze**: Stay in Command Module
   - PRO: More spacious, familiar systems
   - CON: No power, no heat, limited oxygen, will freeze

2. **Squeeze**: Move to Lunar Module as lifeboat
   - PRO: Power available, life support functional
   - CON: Designed for 2, now supporting 3; extremely cramped; uncertain if resources will last

**Historical Decision**: Squeeze into LM "Aquarius" as lifeboat
- **MET ~56:00:00** - Power down Command Module
- All three crew move to LM
- So crowded that moving arms/legs disturbed others
- Sleep deprivation became a major issue
- LM became primary life support

---

## DECISION POINT #3: Navigation Alignment - Stars or Sun/Earth Terminator?

**Context**:
- **Normal Procedure**: Precise star alignment using onboard telescope
  - Crew uses alignment telescope to sight on specific stars
  - Provides highly accurate platform orientation
  - Verified regularly during mission
- **The Problem**: Explosion created massive debris field following spacecraft
  - Glittering "sparklies" - ice crystals and metal fragments
  - Through the alignment telescope, debris looks identical to stars
  - **Impossible to determine which points of light are actual stars**
  - Normal star-sighting alignment unsafe
- Critical trajectory burn approaching after Moon flyby, requires precise alignment

**Options**:
1. **Wait for Debris to Disperse**: Delay burn until star field clears
   - PRO: Use proven star alignment system, highest accuracy
   - CON: Debris may take hours to clear, could risk missing maneuver windows

2. **Use Sun and Earth's Terminator**: Emergency alignment with large, unmistakable targets
   - PRO: Sun is huge and clear; Earth's day/night line (terminator) is visible despite debris; can perform burn on schedule
   - CON: Less precise than star sighting, using two different instruments (AOT and COAS)

**Historical Decision**: Sun and Earth Terminator Alignment
- **GET ~73:46** - "Sun check" passed
- Lovell and Haise used:
  - **Sun** viewed in the LM's **AOT** (Alignment Optical Telescope)
  - **Earth's terminator** (day/night line) viewed in the **COAS** (Crew Optical Alignment Sight)
- Proved the platform was aligned closely enough for the long burn after the Moon
- Clever method became a backup technique for future emergencies

## DECISION POINT #4: CO2 Scrubber Crisis - Mailbox Solution

**Context**:
- CO2 levels rising dangerously in the LM
- **LM's lithium hydroxide (LiOH) canisters are ROUND** and sized for 2 people
- Now supporting 3 people for ~4 days - LM scrubbers running out of capacity
- Command Module has extra **SQUARE** LiOH canisters (unused)
- Problem: **Square canisters won't fit in round LM receptacles**
- CO2 rising into danger zone (deadly above ~15 mmHg)
- Available materials: plastic bags, cardboard, duct tape, hoses, flight manual covers

**Options**:
1. **Do Nothing But Rest**: Reduce physical activity to slow CO2 production
   - PRO: Uses existing systems, no construction needed
   - CON: Not enough - CO2 will still keep rising to deadly levels, impairs decision-making

2. **Build "Mailbox" Adapter**: Create square-to-round adapter
   - PRO: Uses CM's fresh square lithium hydroxide canisters, can sustain 3 people
   - CON: Never attempted, uncertain if materials will seal properly, failure means death

**Historical Decision**: Build the mailbox
- Mission Control engineers designed solution using only materials on board
- Crew built adapter using:
  - Square CM lithium hydroxide canisters
  - Plastic bags
  - Cardboard from flight manual covers
  - Duct tape
  - Hoses
- **CO2 dropped from ~14.9 mmHg to ~4.6 mmHg** - back to safe levels
- Lifesaving ingenuity - solution saved the crew's lives

---

## DECISION POINT #5: Water Conservation Strategy

**Context**:
- **MET ~85:00:00** - Water supplies critical
- Water needed for three purposes:
  1. Drinking water for crew (survival)
  2. Cooling systems for electronics (prevents overheating/fire)
  3. Humidification for breathing (prevents lung damage)
- Current consumption rate: will run dry 18 hours before splashdown

**Options**:
1. **Equal Rationing**: Distribute water evenly across all systems
   - PRO: Balanced approach, maintains all systems partially
   - CON: All three systems degraded, moderate crew dehydration, moderate equipment risk, moderate breathing discomfort

2. **Prioritize Drinking Water**: Give crew adequate water, minimize cooling/humidification
   - PRO: Crew stays hydrated and alert for critical decisions
   - CON: Electronics risk overheating, air becomes painfully dry, potential equipment failures

3. **Prioritize Equipment Cooling**: Keep electronics safe, minimize drinking water
   - PRO: Prevents electrical fires, maintains navigation systems
   - CON: Severe crew dehydration, impaired judgment, physical weakness for re-entry procedures

**Historical Decision**: Extreme rationing - prioritize survival
- Reduced to 6 ounces of water per person per day (normal: 64 oz)
- Minimal equipment cooling - accepted risk of overheating
- Minimal humidification - crew endured dry, painful breathing
- Combined crew weight loss: 31.5 pounds
- Systems held together just long enough

---

### Day 4 - April 14, 1970
- Closest approach to Moon: about **137 nautical miles** (≈**158 miles** / **254 km**) above the surface
- Spacecraft swung behind the Moon (pericynthion)
- Short communication blackout as spacecraft passes behind lunar surface
- Came out headed back to Earth

---

## DECISION POINT #6: Speed Up Burn - The "PC+2" Burn

**Context**:
- Free-return trajectory will get them home, but too late and in the wrong ocean
- Current path would land them far from recovery ships
- Solution: Major burn **2 hours after pericynthion** (PC+2) to speed up and retarget
- Risk: LM Descent Engine (DPS) will run for several minutes in deep space - within design but high-stakes

**Options**:
1. **Coast on Free-Return**: Accept current trajectory
   - PRO: No risk of engine failure, conserves fuel
   - CON: Longer mission time, lands in wrong ocean far from recovery fleet, more time for systems to fail

2. **Perform PC+2 Burn**: Fire LM descent engine for extended burn
   - PRO: Cuts ~9-10 hours off return time, targets Pacific recovery zone near ships
   - CON: Long engine burn (4½-5 minutes) stresses systems, uses significant fuel, any failure leaves crew stranded

**Historical Decision**: Perform the PC+2 burn
- **GET 79:27:40** - PC+2 burn using LM DPS
- About **4½-5 minutes** total burn time
- Roughly **~900 ft/s of delta-V** (velocity change)
- Shortened the trip by ~9-10 hours
- Targeted the Pacific recovery zone near USS Iwo Jima
- Engine performed flawlessly

---

## DECISION POINT #7: Communication Discipline - Silence or Contact?

**Context**:
- **MET ~110:00:00** - Power levels critical
- Radio communication drains precious battery power
- Families on Earth desperate for updates
- Crew psychologically isolated and stressed
- Mission Control needs periodic status checks

**Options**:
1. **Maintain Regular Communication**: Check in every 2 hours
   - PRO: Crew morale supported, families reassured, Mission Control can monitor systems
   - CON: Each transmission drains batteries, could lose 5-8% of remaining power, might not have enough for re-entry computers

2. **Radio Silence**: Minimize communication to emergency-only
   - PRO: Conserves maximum power for re-entry, ensures computer functionality
   - CON: Crew feels abandoned, families terrified, Mission Control can't help if problems develop, 12+ hour silence periods

**Historical Decision**: Strict communication discipline
- Reduced communications to essential status updates only
- Some silence periods lasted 6+ hours
- Families and public endured agonizing waits
- Saved enough power for critical re-entry systems
- Batteries had only 20% remaining at splashdown

---

### Day 5 - April 15-16, 1970
- Crew enduring extreme conditions:
  - Temperature: 38-50°F (depending on module)
  - Water: 6 oz/day per person
  - Sleep: Minimal, broken
  - Food: Limited intake due to cold and stress
- Fred Haise developing kidney/urinary infection from dehydration
- All crew suffering from exhaustion
- **GET ~105:18** - Small manual mid-course correction (~7-8 ft/s)
  - Used Earth's day/night line and Sun as visual guides
  - Fine-tuned trajectory for Pacific splashdown zone
- To save power, crew turned off high-power radio amp
  - Used low-power "Down Voice Backup" when possible
  - Some communication periods very quiet

---

## DECISION POINT #8: Battery Jump-Start - Untested Procedure

**Context**:
- **MET ~138:00:00** - Approaching Earth
- Command Module needed for re-entry (only module with heat shield)
- CM batteries drained to 2% during 4-day power-down
- LM has remaining battery power
- Need to transfer power from LM to CM
- Procedure never tested, could short-circuit both systems

**Options**:
1. **Use Only CM Reserve Batteries**: Attempt re-entry with 2% power
   - PRO: No risk of short-circuit, avoids untested procedure
   - CON: Insufficient power for computers, parachutes, life support; crew will die on re-entry

2. **Jump-Start from LM**: Connect LM batteries to charge CM
   - PRO: Can fully charge CM batteries for re-entry systems
   - CON: Never attempted, could short both systems, might electrocute crew, could lose all power

**Historical Decision**: Attempt the jump-start
- Houston designed brand-new power-up and charge procedure (never done before)
- Connected LM batteries to CM charging system
- Successfully transferred power without short-circuit
- One CM battery even briefly "dropped off the line" but recovered
- Charged CM batteries to sufficient levels for re-entry
- This made re-entry possible - innovative solution added to NASA emergency procedures

## DECISION POINT #9: Service Module Jettison - When to Let Go?

**Context**:
- **MET 137:00:00** - Approaching re-entry window
- Damaged Service Module still attached
- Must jettison before re-entry, but timing is critical
- SM provides radiation shielding and thermal protection

**Options**:
1. **Early Jettison**: Release SM 6 hours before re-entry
   - PRO: Can photograph damage for investigation, reduces mass for more accurate trajectory, eliminates risk of collision during re-entry
   - CON: Crew exposed to more radiation from Van Allen belts, lose thermal protection sooner, temperatures drop further

2. **Late Jettison**: Keep SM until 1 hour before re-entry
   - PRO: Maximum radiation protection, thermal barrier against space cold
   - CON: Cannot assess damage, tight timeline if jettison fails, risk of SM colliding with CM during separation

**Historical Decision**: Early jettison
- **GET 138:02** - Jettisoned Service Module
- Crew photographed damage for first time
- Saw entire panel blown off (the wrecked panel), massive structural damage
- Realized how close they came to disaster
- Lovell: "There's one whole side of that spacecraft missing!"
- Confirmed they were right to avoid using the SPS engine

---

### Day 6 - April 17, 1970 (Return to Earth)

- **GET 141:30** - Jettison Lunar Module "Aquarius"
  - CapCom Joe Kerwin: "Farewell, Aquarius, and we thank you"
  - The trusty lifeboat was cut loose
  - LM had saved their lives for 4 days
  - Now must separate for CM re-entry

---

## DECISION POINT #10: Re-Entry Angle - Computer Restart or Manual Flight?

**Context**:
- Final approach to Earth's atmosphere
- **The Re-entry Corridor**: Extremely narrow margin (Apollo targeted about **-6.5°**)
  - **Acceptable window: roughly -5.25° to -7.4°** (only ~2° total margin!)
  - **Too shallow** (less steep than -5.25°): Spacecraft **skips off** atmosphere into space
  - **Too steep** (steeper than -7.4°): Spacecraft suffers **excessive heat/g-forces**
  - Precision required: Maintain angle within corridor during entire re-entry
  - **Manual control**: Nearly impossible to maintain precise angle
- **The Computer Problem**:
  - Command Module guidance computer powered down for days (since GET ~56)
  - CM has been **freezing cold** (38-50°F) with no heat
  - **Water condensation on walls**, ice formation on systems
  - Guidance computer **NOT designed to be turned off and restarted**
  - **Unknown if it will restart** after days in freezing conditions
- **Battery Status**: Jump-start successful, but power limited

**Options**:
1. **Manual Re-entry**: Don't risk restarting frozen guidance computer
   - PRO: Avoids potential computer failure, saves battery power
   - CON: Maintaining precise angle manually nearly impossible, crew exhausted after 6 days, one mistake means death, extremely low success probability

2. **Restart Guidance Computer**: Attempt to power up frozen systems
   - PRO: Computer can automatically maintain precise angle within corridor, controls all rocket adjustments, far higher survival probability
   - CON: Computer may not restart after days frozen, condensation may have damaged circuits, restart drains critical battery power, if startup fails no time to switch to manual

**Historical Decision**: Risk the computer restart
- Power-up succeeded - the guidance computer came back!
- **GET 142:40:46** - **Entry Interface** (400,000 ft altitude)
- Computer-guided entry kept them in the corridor
- Entry flight-path angle **~6.2°** for Apollo 13's final PAD (perfectly within -5.25° to -7.4° window!)
- **Splashdown: 12:07:44 p.m. CST, April 17, 1970**
- Pacific Ocean, near USS Iwo Jima
- All crew survived
- Computer performed flawlessly despite never being designed for shutdown/restart cycle
