## What Is This?

On April 13, 1970, an oxygen tank exploded aboard Apollo 13 while traveling to the Moon. Three astronauts—**Jim Lovell**, **Jack Swigert**, and **Fred Haise**—were suddenly fighting for their lives in a crippled spacecraft.

This interactive website lets you experience their story and **make the same critical decisions** that NASA engineers and astronauts faced during the rescue mission.

### Perfect For:

- 🏕️ **Scouts** exploring STEM merit badges
- 🎓 **Students** learning about space exploration
- 👨‍💻 **Young coders** who want to see how websites are built
- 🚀 **Space enthusiasts** of all ages

## How It Works

### 📱 33 Interactive Pages
Navigate through the mission timeline from launch to splashdown, plus earn merit badges:
- **9 Narrative Slides** - Experience the story as it happened
- **10 Decision Points** - Make critical choices (will you match NASA's decisions?)
- **10 Info Slides** - Learn the science and engineering behind the rescue
- **4 Merit Badge Resources** - Detailed guides for earning Programming, Digital Technology, and Space Exploration merit badges

### 🎯 Make Real Decisions
Face the same impossible choices NASA did:
- Move to the Lunar Module or stay in the Command Module?
- Turn around immediately or use the Moon's gravity?
- Speed up the return with a risky engine burn?
- Build an improvised CO₂ scrubber or risk suffocation?
- Navigate using stars or Sun/Earth alignment?
- Shut down the Command Module to save power?
- Ration water supplies for crew or equipment?
- Maintain radio contact or enforce silence to save batteries?
- Attempt an untested battery jump-start?
- When to jettison the damaged Service Module?

### 🏆 Earn Your Rank
Compare your decisions to NASA's actual choices:
- 🏆 **Mission Commander** - 10/10 correct (You think like NASA!)
- ⭐ **Flight Director** - 8-9/10 correct
- 🎯 **Flight Controller** - 6-7/10 correct
- 📡 **Ground Crew** - 0-5/10 correct

## For Young Coders: How This Website Was Built

**Want to learn how to build something like this?** Great! Here's what makes this website work:

### 🛠️ Technology Stack

This website is built with the **simplest possible tech stack** - perfect for learning:

- **HTML** - Structures the content (the slides, buttons, text)
- **CSS** - Makes it look good (colors, fonts, layout)
- **JavaScript** - Makes it interactive (decisions, scoring, progress tracking)
- **GitHub Pages** - Free hosting (anyone can access it)

**That's it!** No complicated frameworks, no database, no server required.

### 📁 Project Structure

```
apollo-mission/
├── index.html              # Home page
├── timeline.html           # Timeline navigator
├── slides/                 # 24 HTML files (one per slide)
│   ├── 01-launch.html
│   ├── 02-freeze-squeeze.html
│   └── ... 22 more slides
├── assets/
│   ├── css/style.css      # All the styling (580 lines)
│   ├── js/app.js          # All the JavaScript (370 lines)
│   └── images/            # Pictures for each slide
└── README.md              # This file!
```

**Total size**: Less than 1,200 lines of code! You could read all of it in an afternoon.

### 🎨 Cool Features You Can Learn From

**1. Decision Tracking** - Uses `localStorage` to remember your choices
**2. Score Calculation** - Compares your decisions to NASA's actual choices
**3. URL Sharing** - Encodes your score into a shareable link
**4. Keyboard Navigation** - Arrow keys work to move between slides
**5. Responsive Design** - Automatically adjusts for phone/tablet/desktop
**6. Progress Indicators** - Shows which slides you've visited

### 💡 Want to Build Your Own Version?

You could make a similar interactive story about:
- The Wright Brothers' first flight
- The Titanic rescue mission
- Lewis and Clark's expedition
- Mars Rover missions
- Your own troop's camping trip history!

**Start simple:**
1. Pick a story with 10-15 key events
2. Create HTML files for each event (copy the structure from this project)
3. Add images (NASA images are free to use!)
4. Add decision points where choices matter
5. Deploy for free on GitHub Pages
