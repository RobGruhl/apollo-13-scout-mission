                <details class="info-section" open>
                    <summary>🏭 Delco Electronics & The Guidance Systems</summary>
                    <div style="padding: 1.5rem;">
                        <h4>Where Apollo's "Eyes" Were Built:</h4>
                        <p>While MIT's Instrumentation Lab designed the Apollo Guidance Computer, the precision gyroscopes that told the spacecraft where it was in space came from Delco Electronics in Oak Creek, Wisconsin.</p>

                        <div style="background: white; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                            <h4>What Made Delco's Gyroscopes Special:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>🔬 Built from beryllium - an incredibly light, toxic metal</li>
                                <li>🏭 Assembled in clean rooms (both for precision and safety)</li>
                                <li>🎯 More accurate than any other gyroscopes in the world</li>
                                <li>✨ So precise that astronauts almost never needed to realign them</li>
                                <li>🌙 Used in BOTH the Command Module and Lunar Module</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-style: italic;">These weren't just backup systems. The gyroscopes were how Apollo knew which way was "up" in space, where Earth was, and how to navigate home.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Not Just Apollo:</h4>
                        <p>Delco built guidance systems for:</p>
                        <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                            <li>🚀 Apollo Command and Lunar Modules</li>
                            <li>💣 Minuteman Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles</li>

                            <li>🎖️ Main Battle Tank fire control</li>
                            <li>✈️ Boeing 747 carousel guidance systems</li>

                    <summary>💻 Ed's Role: Making Sure They Had Enough Gyroscopes</summary>
                    <div style="padding: 1.5rem;">
                        <h4>The Problem Ed Solved:</h4>
                        <p>Building precision gyroscopes was incredibly difficult. At each stage of assembly:</p>
                        <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                            <li>❌ Some units would fail quality testing</li>
                            <li>🔧 Some failed units could be salvaged and repaired</li>
                            <li>📊 Each assembly line had different yield rates</li>
                            <li>⏰ Apollo needed X finished gyroscopes by specific dates</li>
                        </ul>

                        <div style="background: var(--bg-yellow-light); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                            <h4>The Challenge:</h4>
                            <p>If you need 10 finished gyroscopes at the end, and the final assembly stage has a 90% success rate, you need to start with 11 units going into that stage. But what about the stage before that? And before that? And the salvage rates? And the repair times?</p>

                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-weight: 700;">Working backwards through 8+ assembly stages with different yields was beyond what humans could calculate manually.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Ed's Solution:</h4>
                        <p>Ed maintained and improved a sophisticated scheduling program that:</p>
                        <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                            <li>✅ Worked backwards from the required delivery date</li>
                            <li>✅ Accounted for yield rates at each assembly stage</li>
                            <li>✅ Factored in salvage and repair rates</li>
                            <li>✅ Told manufacturing exactly how many units to start each week</li>
                            <li>✅ Ensured Apollo always had the gyroscopes it needed</li>
                        </ul>

                        <div style="background: var(--bg-blue-light); padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                            <p style="font-weight: 700;">In his own words from the interview:</p>
                            <blockquote style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                                "To do this mentally was very, very hard. But what this would do was it would back these off and they might know that they needed to start 40 units the first week and then 10 the second and so on. This program was used by the ICBM group, the main battle tank group, the ship's fire control group, and the 747 group."
                            </blockquote>
                        </div>

                        <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Why This Mattered:</h4>
                        <p>Without accurate scheduling, one of two things would happen:</p>
                        <ol style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                            <li>Not enough gyroscopes ready → Mission delayed or cancelled</li>
                            <li>Too many units started → Wasted money and resources</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Ed's program kept production running efficiently while ensuring every Apollo mission had the guidance systems it needed.</p>

                        <p>The Apollo group at Delco had something special: a squawk box - a speaker system connected directly to Mission Control in Houston and the astronauts in space.</p>

                            <p>During critical moments of Apollo missions, Ed would find reasons to visit the Apollo group's area. Through that squawk box, he heard:</p>
                            <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                                <li>🎙️ Real-time communications between astronauts and Mission Control</li>
                                <li>🎙️ Flight directors making decisions</li>
                                <li>🎙️ The tension and urgency during Apollo 13's crisis</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">The Apollo 13 Moment:</h4>
                            <p>Ed was at Delco during the entire Apollo 13 crisis. When the Command Module was shut down and reprogramming was sent to the Lunar Module, nobody knew if it would work while they were behind the Moon.</p>

                            <blockquote style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                                "When they cleared the moon and the communication came through with them, and they were asking what their heading was, and they said, 'Back to Earth,' the guys in the Apollo group cheered. Because they weren't the guys who sent the astronauts into outer space."

                        <p>Ed's brother Jim worked directly on gyroscope control theory. His contribution:</p>

                            <h4>The Gimbal Problem:</h4>
                            <p>A gyroscope has a rotating mass that maintains orientation. Around it is a gimbal - a support structure that needs to track the gyroscope's movement.</p>

                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The gimbal can't just follow the gyroscope. It needs to <em>anticipate</em> where it's going. If the gyroscope starts turning, the gimbal should overshoot slightly because the turn will probably continue.</p>

                            <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Jim's Solution:</h4>
                            <p>Jim developed 12 pages of formulas for the automatic control theory that allowed the gimbal motor mechanism to catch up in optimal time. This math was embedded directly into the guidance program.</p>

                            <blockquote style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                                "My brother Jim actually came up with 12 pages of formulas that allowed the gimbal motor mechanism to catch up in an optimum amount of time."

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Teaching Through Experience</h3>
                    <p>Ed doesn't just teach the history of Apollo 13. He teaches:</p>

                    <ul style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        <li>🧠 <strong>Systems thinking:</strong> How everything connects (power, water, oxygen, navigation)</li>
                        <li>⚖️ <strong>Decision-making under pressure:</strong> No perfect choices, only better ones</li>
                        <li>🤝 <strong>Teamwork:</strong> How thousands of people working together saved three lives</li>
                        <li>📐 <strong>Engineering precision:</strong> Why getting the math right mattered life-or-death</li>
                        <li>💡 <strong>Creative problem-solving:</strong> Making a square peg fit a round hole - literally</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">The decisions you just made in this interactive? Ed watched real engineers make those exact calls. He heard the communications through the squawk box. He knew people who built the simulators, wrote the procedures, calculated the burns.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-weight: 700;">This isn't just history to him. It's personal.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6;">
                        The gyroscopes that told Odyssey and Aquarius where they were in space?<br>
                        Ed helped make sure they were ready when NASA needed them.<br><br>

                        The precision that let astronauts navigate home with Earth and Sun sightings?<br>
                        That precision came from beryllium gyroscopes built where Ed worked.<br><br>

                        The thousands of engineers who refused to let Apollo 13 fail?<br>
                        Ed was one of them.<br><br>

                        And now he's here, teaching you the lessons he learned<br>
                        from one of humanity's greatest rescues.

                    <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                        <li>What did it feel like hearing "Back to Earth" through the squawk box?</li>
                        <li>How accurate were the beryllium gyroscopes compared to others?</li>
                        <li>Did you ever worry the guidance systems might fail?</li>
                        <li>What was the closest call with the draft deferment?</li>
                        <li>What surprised you most about how Apollo 13 was solved?</li>
                        <li>Did your brother Jim ever tell you about developing the gimbal formulas?</li>
                        <li>What happened to the land in Wisconsin you bought from the Apollo engineers?</li>
                    </ul>
