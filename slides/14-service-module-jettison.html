                <h2>Why Jettison the Service Module?</h2>
                <p>For nearly 4 days, the crew had been flying blind. They knew the Service Module (SM) was damaged, but they couldn't see it. The SM was attached behind the Command Module, out of view.</p>

                <div style="background: var(--bg-light); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                    <h3>The Configuration:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Front:</strong> Lunar Module "Aquarius" (crew inside)</li>
                        <li><strong>Middle:</strong> Command Module "Odyssey" (powered down)</li>
                        <li><strong>Back:</strong> Service Module (damaged, attached to CM)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The SM had to be jettisoned before re-entry because:</p>
                    <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                        <li>❌ Too heavy to bring through atmosphere</li>
                        <li>❌ Not designed to survive re-entry heat</li>
                        <li>❌ Would block heat shield on Command Module</li>
                        <li>❌ Had to be discarded to expose CM heat shield</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>GET 138:01:48 - The Jettison</h2>
                <p>Mission Control radioed up: <em>"Okay, you are go for SM sep."</em></p>

                <div style="background: var(--bg-light); border-left: 4px solid var(--nasa-blue); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                    <h4>The Process:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Jack Swigert armed the SM jettison controls in the Command Module</li>
                        <li>On Houston's count, he fired the separation pyros</li>
                        <li><strong>BANG!</strong> - Explosive bolts fired</li>
                        <li>Springs pushed the SM away from the CM</li>
                        <li>Small thrusters fired to ensure clean separation</li>
                        <li>The SM drifted away into space</li>
                    </ol>

                <h2 style="color: var(--crisis-red); margin-top: 2rem;">Seeing the Damage for the First Time</h2>
                <p>As the Service Module tumbled away, the crew maneuvered the LM to get their first look at the damage. What they saw shocked them into silence.</p>

                <div style="background: var(--bg-light); border: 3px solid var(--crisis-red); padding: 2rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 2rem 0;">
                    <h3 style="color: var(--crisis-red); margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The Damage:</h3>

                    <h4>Entire Bay 4 Panel Blown Away:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>💥 <strong>13-foot panel completely gone</strong> - ripped clean off the spacecraft</li>
                        <li>💥 Panel was 1/6 of SM's outer skin - like having 1/6 of your car's body missing</li>
                        <li>💥 Exposed internal structure and equipment to space</li>
                        <li>💥 Sharp, jagged metal edges where panel tore away</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Internal Devastation:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>🔥 <strong>Oxygen tank #2 completely destroyed</strong> - blown to pieces</li>
                        <li>🔥 <strong>Oxygen tank #1 damaged</strong> - cracked, leaking</li>
                        <li>🔥 Fuel cell bay #1 and #3 - destroyed by explosion</li>
                        <li>🔥 Wiring harnesses - melted, severed</li>
                        <li>🔥 Plumbing lines - ruptured, twisted</li>
                        <li>🔥 Structural members - bent, fractured</li>
                        <li>🔥 Insulation - scorched black from fire</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Debris Field:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>🌌 Pieces of equipment floating around the SM</li>
                        <li>🌌 Insulation fragments drifting away</li>
                        <li>🌌 Ice crystals from vented oxygen</li>
                        <li>🌌 The whole SM tumbling end-over-end</li>
                    </ul>

                        <p style="font-weight: 700; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Jim Lovell's First Words:</p>
                        <blockquote style="margin: 0;">
                            "And there's one whole side of that spacecraft missing!"
                            <cite>— Jim Lovell, GET 138:03:00</cite>
                        </blockquote>

                        <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem; font-weight: 700; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Then, after a long pause:</p>
                        <blockquote style="margin: 0;">
                            "Right by the high-gain antenna. The whole panel is blown out, almost from the base to the engine."
                            <cite>— Jim Lovell</cite>
                        </blockquote>
                    </div>

                    <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem; font-weight: 700; color: var(--crisis-red);">
                        The crew realized for the first time just how close they had come to instant death. If that explosion had been a few feet in a different direction, it could have breached the Command Module hull. They would have had seconds to live.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2>The Crew's Reaction</h2>
                <div style="background: var(--bg-yellow-light); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                    <h4>Jim Lovell (Commander):</h4>
                    <p>Stunned silence, then clinical description of damage to Houston. Years of training kept his voice calm, but inside he was shaken. <em>"How did we survive that?"</em></p>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Jack Swigert (CM Pilot):</h4>
                    <p>Quiet. Swigert had been the one who flipped the switch to stir the tanks. Seeing the damage was his first real understanding of what that simple switch flip had caused. No blame—it wasn't his fault—but the weight was heavy.</p>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Fred Haise (LM Pilot):</h4>
                    <p>Sick with fever (103°F from kidney infection), dehydrated, exhausted. Seeing the SM was surreal. <em>"That's the spacecraft that was supposed to take us to the Moon and back. And now it's just... junk."</em></p>
                </div>

                <h2>Mission Control's Reaction</h2>
                <div style="background: var(--bg-blue-light); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                    <p>When Lovell transmitted the first photos of the damage back to Earth, Mission Control went silent.</p>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem;">What They Saw:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Catastrophic structural damage worse than any simulation</li>
                        <li>Evidence of massive explosion - far more violent than they'd estimated</li>
                        <li>Proof that three astronauts had survived something that should have killed them instantly</li>
                    </ul>

                    <blockquote style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                        "When we saw those pictures, we couldn't believe they were still alive. That explosion should have killed them. The fact that they survived it, and that Aquarius kept them alive for four days... it was a miracle."
                        <cite>— Gene Kranz, Flight Director</cite>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem; font-weight: 700;">
                        The engineers studying the photos realized something terrifying: <strong>the explosion had occurred right next to the CM's side hatch.</strong> If the blast had been oriented differently, it could have blown the hatch open or punctured the CM hull. The crew would have died in seconds.
                    </p>

                <h2>The New Fear: Heat Shield Damage</h2>
                <div style="background: var(--bg-light); border: 3px solid var(--caution-yellow); padding: 2rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 2rem 0;">
                    <h3 style="color: var(--caution-yellow); margin-bottom: 1rem;">⚠️ Critical Question:</h3>
                    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        <strong>Was the Command Module's heat shield damaged by the explosion?</strong>
                    </p>

                    <h4>Why This Mattered:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>🛡️ Heat shield is on the <strong>bottom</strong> of Command Module</li>
                        <li>🛡️ Explosion occurred on the <strong>side</strong> of Service Module</li>
                        <li>🛡️ Blast wave and debris could have damaged CM hull</li>
                        <li>🛡️ CM and SM were docked together when explosion happened</li>
                        <li>🛡️ Any crack or hole in heat shield = certain death during re-entry</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">The Problem:</h4>
                    <p>The crew <strong>couldn't see the heat shield</strong> while it was attached to the SM. They wouldn't know if it was damaged until:</p>
                    <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                        <li>❌ Option 1: Jettison CM and LM, look at it from outside (impossible - would die)</li>
                        <li>❌ Option 2: Wait until re-entry and hope it works (only option)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Mission Control's Assessment:</h4>
                    <div style="background: white; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; margin-top: 1rem;">
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>Engineers analyzed:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Explosion direction and force</li>
                            <li>CM/SM docking configuration</li>
                            <li>Heat shield attachment method</li>
                            <li>Blast wave propagation patterns</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-weight: 700;">
                            <strong>Conclusion:</strong> "Probably okay, but we can't be sure."
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: var(--caution-yellow);">
                            Translation: We're 80% confident it's fine. But there's a 20% chance they'll burn up during re-entry.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem; font-weight: 700; color: var(--crisis-red);">
                        This became one more unknown factor. One more thing to worry about. One more way they could die even if everything else worked perfectly.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2>The Symbolic Moment</h2>
                <p>Watching the Service Module tumble away into the darkness was profound for the crew:</p>

                <div style="background: var(--bg-light); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                    <h4>What the SM Represented:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>🚀 Their ride to the Moon (mission failed)</li>
                        <li>⚡ Their power source (destroyed)</li>
                        <li>💨 Their oxygen supply (gone)</li>
                        <li>🏠 Their living quarters (uninhabitable)</li>
                        <li>🌙 Their dreams of walking on the Moon (dead)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem; font-style: italic;">
                        It was like watching their original mission die. The mission they'd trained years for. The mission that was supposed to make them the 7th, 8th, and 9th humans to walk on the Moon.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-weight: 700;">
                        All that remained now was survival.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <blockquote style="margin: 2rem 0; font-size: 1.1rem;">
                    "Farewell, Aquarius, and we thank you."
                    <cite>— Jim Lovell, after jettisoning the LM (later, just before re-entry)</cite>
                </blockquote>

                <p style="font-style: italic;">(Note: This quote actually came when they jettisoned the LM, but it captures the emotion of letting go of the spacecraft that saved their lives.)</p>

                <h2 style="margin-top: 2rem;">What Happened to the Service Module?</h2>
                <div style="background: var(--bg-light); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                    <p>The SM was left in orbit around Earth. Over the following weeks and months:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>🌍 Orbit gradually decayed from atmospheric drag</li>
                        <li>🔥 Eventually re-entered Earth's atmosphere</li>
                        <li>💥 Burned up completely over the Pacific Ocean</li>
                        <li>🌊 Any surviving fragments fell into the ocean, unrecovered</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-style: italic;">
                        No piece of Apollo 13's Service Module was ever recovered. The only evidence of its destruction comes from the photos Jim Lovell took during jettison and the testimony of the crew.
