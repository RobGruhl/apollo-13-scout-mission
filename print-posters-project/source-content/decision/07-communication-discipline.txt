DECISION POINT #7
COMMUNICATION DISCIPLINE
GET ~110:00:00 | Battery Power Critical

=== THE SITUATION ===
â–¸ Power levels criticalâ€”every amp-hour counts
â–¸ Radio communication drains precious battery power
â–¸ Families on Earth desperate for updates on crew status
â–¸ Crew psychologically isolated and stressed in freezing LM
â–¸ Mission Control needs periodic status checks
â–¸ Batteries must last for re-entry computer and parachute deployment

=== OPTION 1: MAINTAIN REGULAR COMMUNICATION ===
Subtitle: Check in with Mission Control every 2 hours

PROS:
â€¢ Crew morale supportedâ€”feels connected to Earth
â€¢ Families reassured that crew is alive
â€¢ Mission Control can monitor systems and troubleshoot
â€¢ Crew can ask questions and get guidance
â€¢ Public stays informed of progress

CONS:
â€¢ Each transmission drains batteries significantly
â€¢ Could lose 5-8% of remaining power with regular comms
â€¢ Might not have enough power for re-entry computers
â€¢ Radio heater uses power even when not transmitting
â€¢ Could die during re-entry due to dead batteries

=== OPTION 2: RADIO SILENCE ===
Subtitle: Minimize communication to emergency-only

PROS:
â€¢ Conserves maximum power for re-entry
â€¢ Ensures computer functionality during critical phases
â€¢ Saves power for parachute deployment systems
â€¢ More margin for error with remaining batteries
â€¢ Power available for unexpected emergencies

CONS:
â€¢ Crew feels abandoned and alone
â€¢ Families terrifiedâ€”no updates for 12+ hours
â€¢ Mission Control can't help if problems develop silently
â€¢ Psychological toll on crew is severe
â€¢ No guidance for unexpected situations
â€¢ Public assumes the worst during silence

=== DECISION PROMPT ===
ðŸ¤” WHAT SHOULD THE CREW DO?

=== HISTORICAL DECISION ===
NASA chose STRICT COMMUNICATION DISCIPLINE
â€¢ Reduced communications to essential status updates only
â€¢ Some silence periods lasted 6+ hours
â€¢ Families and public endured agonizing waits for news
â€¢ Crew felt isolated but understood necessity
â€¢ Mission Control blind to real-time problems
â€¢ Saved enough power for critical re-entry systems
â€¢ Batteries had only ~20% remaining at splashdown
â€¢ Close callâ€”wouldn't have made it with regular comms
