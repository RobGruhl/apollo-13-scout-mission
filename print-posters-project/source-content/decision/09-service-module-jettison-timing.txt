DECISION POINT #9
SERVICE MODULE JETTISON TIMING
GET 138:02 | When to Let Go?

=== THE SITUATION ===
â–¸ Approaching re-entry windowâ€”must shed weight
â–¸ Damaged Service Module still attached to Command Module
â–¸ Must jettison SM before re-entry, but timing is critical
â–¸ SM provides radiation shielding and thermal protection
â–¸ Need to photograph damage for investigation
â–¸ Risk of collision if jettison goes wrong

=== OPTION 1: EARLY JETTISON ===
Subtitle: Release SM 6 hours before re-entry

PROS:
â€¢ Can photograph damage for NASA investigation
â€¢ Reduces mass for more accurate trajectory calculations
â€¢ Eliminates risk of SM collision during re-entry
â€¢ More time to troubleshoot if jettison mechanism fails
â€¢ Clear separation before critical phases

CONS:
â€¢ Crew exposed to more radiation from Van Allen belts
â€¢ Lose thermal protection barrier sooner
â€¢ Temperatures drop even further (already 38Â°F)
â€¢ More time exposed to cosmic radiation
â€¢ Psychological impact of seeing damage

=== OPTION 2: LATE JETTISON ===
Subtitle: Keep SM until 1 hour before re-entry

PROS:
â€¢ Maximum radiation protection through Van Allen belts
â€¢ Thermal barrier against space cold maintained longer
â€¢ Crew stays warmer for longer
â€¢ Less time for things to go wrong after separation

CONS:
â€¢ Cannot assess or photograph damage
â€¢ Extremely tight timeline if jettison fails
â€¢ Risk of SM colliding with CM during separation
â€¢ No margin for errorâ€”one chance only
â€¢ Blind to actual damage until after landing

=== DECISION PROMPT ===
ðŸ¤” WHAT SHOULD THE CREW DO?

=== HISTORICAL DECISION ===
NASA chose EARLY JETTISON
â€¢ GET 138:02 - Jettisoned Service Module
â€¢ Crew photographed damage for first time
â€¢ Saw entire panel blown offâ€”massive structural damage
â€¢ Lovell: "There's one whole side of that spacecraft missing!"
â€¢ Explosion had ripped off entire 13-foot panel
â€¢ Realized how close they came to complete disaster
â€¢ Confirmed they were right to avoid using the SPS engine
â€¢ Photos critical for investigating failure and preventing future accidents
