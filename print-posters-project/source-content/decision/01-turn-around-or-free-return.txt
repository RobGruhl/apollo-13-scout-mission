DECISION POINT #1
TURN AROUND OR FREE-RETURN?
GET ~61:29:42 | Post-Explosion Crisis

=== THE SITUATION ===
â–¸ Oxygen tank explosion at GET 55:54:53 (~200,000 miles from Earth)
â–¸ Currently traveling ~24,000 mph away from Earth
â–¸ Service module damaged, command module rocket uncertain
â–¸ Fuel cells offline, running on backup batteries
â–¸ Must decide route home: direct reversal or loop around Moon

=== OPTION 1: TURN AROUND ===
Subtitle: Blast retrograde to stop and reverse direction

PROS:
â€¢ Fastest route home (shortest total time)
â€¢ Direct path back to Earth
â€¢ Familiar trajectory calculations
â€¢ No need to wait for Moon flyby

CONS:
â€¢ Requires massive fuel burn
â€¢ Risks explosion of damaged systems
â€¢ Burns through all LM descent fuel
â€¢ May damage weakened spacecraft structure
â€¢ Untested with damaged systems

=== OPTION 2: FREE-RETURN TRAJECTORY ===
Subtitle: Use Moon's gravity to slingshot back

PROS:
â€¢ Safer for damaged systems
â€¢ Uses significantly less fuel
â€¢ Proven orbital mechanics (tested on Apollo 8, 10)
â€¢ Uses undamaged LM descent engine
â€¢ Conserves resources for course corrections

CONS:
â€¢ Takes much longer (must loop around Moon first)
â€¢ Crew waits 4+ days in damaged spacecraft
â€¢ More time for systems to fail
â€¢ Psychological stress of waiting
â€¢ More consumables needed (oxygen, water, power)

=== DECISION PROMPT ===
ðŸ¤” WHAT SHOULD THE CREW DO?

=== HISTORICAL DECISION ===
NASA chose FREE-RETURN TRAJECTORY
â€¢ GET 61:29:42 - DPS burn (~31 seconds using LM descent engine)
â€¢ Put spacecraft back on free-return path that loops behind Moon
â€¢ Safer approach that doesn't stress damaged systems
â€¢ Used undamaged LM engine instead of risky CSM engine
â€¢ Required patience but conserved critical resources
