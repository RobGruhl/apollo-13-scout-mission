DECISION POINT #6
SPEED UP BURN (PC+2)?
GET 79:27:40 | Wrong Ocean Landing Zone

=== THE SITUATION ===
â–¸ Free-return trajectory will get them home, but too late and in wrong ocean
â–¸ Current path would land far from recovery ships (wrong ocean)
â–¸ Solution: Major burn 2 hours after pericynthion (PC+2) to speed up and retarget
â–¸ Risk: LM Descent Engine will run for 4Â½-5 minutes in deep space
â–¸ Longest burn yetâ€”within design limits but high-stakes

=== OPTION 1: COAST ON FREE-RETURN ===
Subtitle: Accept current trajectoryâ€”no additional burn

PROS:
â€¢ No risk of engine failure during critical burn
â€¢ Conserves fuel for emergency corrections
â€¢ Simpleâ€”no complex maneuvers
â€¢ Systems already stressedâ€”why add more risk?

CONS:
â€¢ Longer mission time (~9-10 hours extra)
â€¢ Lands in wrong ocean, far from recovery fleet
â€¢ More time for systems to fail
â€¢ Longer exposure to cold, dehydration, CO2
â€¢ Recovery ships must repositionâ€”delays rescue

=== OPTION 2: PERFORM PC+2 BURN ===
Subtitle: Fire LM descent engine for extended burn to retarget

PROS:
â€¢ Cuts ~9-10 hours off return time
â€¢ Targets Pacific recovery zone near USS Iwo Jima
â€¢ Less time for systems to fail
â€¢ Faster medical attention for crew
â€¢ Ships already positioned and waiting

CONS:
â€¢ Long engine burn (4Â½-5 minutes) stresses systems
â€¢ Uses significant fuel (~900 ft/s delta-V)
â€¢ Any failure during burn leaves crew stranded
â€¢ Engine designed for lunar landing, not deep space burns
â€¢ Single point of failureâ€”if engine quits, no backup

=== DECISION PROMPT ===
ðŸ¤” WHAT SHOULD THE CREW DO?

=== HISTORICAL DECISION ===
NASA chose PERFORM THE PC+2 BURN
â€¢ GET 79:27:40 - PC+2 burn using LM descent engine
â€¢ Burn duration: ~4Â½-5 minutes total
â€¢ Velocity change: ~900 ft/s of delta-V
â€¢ Shortened the trip by ~9-10 hours
â€¢ Targeted Pacific recovery zone near USS Iwo Jima
â€¢ Engine performed flawlesslyâ€”never missed a beat
â€¢ Crew grateful for shorter journey in freezing, cramped LM
