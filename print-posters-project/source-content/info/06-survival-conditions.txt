INFO SLIDE #6
SURVIVAL CONDITIONS
Four Days in a Freezing, Cramped Lifeboat

=== THE LUNAR MODULE AS LIFEBOAT ===
Designed For: 2 astronauts, 45 hours (Moon landing mission)
Apollo 13 Reality: 3 astronauts, 87+ hours (4 days in space)

That's 2.9x the intended use!

=== TEMPERATURE: THE FREEZING CHALLENGE ===
The Cold Reality:

Inside Aquarius:
• Temperature: 38°F (3°C) minimum
• Some areas: 50°F
• Colder than a refrigerator
• Below freezing in some spots

Why So Cold?
• Power conservation = minimal heaters
• Electronics powered down to save batteries
• Service Module damaged (no heat from there)
• Space is -455°F (-270°C) all around
• Only thin aluminum walls for insulation

What the Crew Experienced:
❄️ Shivering constantly (can't get warm)
❄️ Numb fingers and toes
❄️ Difficulty sleeping (too cold)
❄️ Water condensation on every surface
❄️ Ice forming on windows and equipment
❄️ Can see breath in cabin air
❄️ Frostbite risk on extremities

Condensation Problem:
• Crew breathing creates moisture
• Cold walls cause condensation
• Water droplets float in zero gravity
• Equipment could short-circuit
• Constant worry about electrical systems

Medical Impact:
• Hypothermia risk
• Slowed reactions and thinking
• Reduced immune system function
• Fred Haise's kidney infection worsened by cold

No Warm Clothing:
• Only thin flight suits
• No space for heavy jackets
• Spacesuits too bulky to wear constantly
• Just had to endure the cold

=== WATER: SEVERE RATIONING ===
The Water Crisis:

Normal Consumption: 64 oz per person per day (8 cups)
Apollo 13 Ration: 6 oz per person per day (3/4 cup)

That's 1/10th of normal water intake!

Water Uses on Spacecraft:
1. Drinking (crew survival)
2. Cooling electronics (prevents overheating/fires)
3. Humidifying air (prevents lung damage from dry air)

The Rationing Decision:
• Prioritize crew survival (minimal drinking water)
• Minimal electronics cooling (accept risk)
• Minimal humidification (painful but survivable)

What 6 Ounces Looks Like:
• Less than 1 cup total per day
• 2-3 small sips every few hours
• Barely enough to swallow food
• Severe dehydration guaranteed

Effects of Dehydration:
🥵 Extreme thirst (dry mouth, cracked lips)
🥵 Dizziness and lightheadedness
🥵 Impaired judgment and confusion
🥵 Physical weakness
🥵 Kidney stress (Fred Haise's infection)
🥵 Dark urine (concentrated)
🥵 Headaches

Medical Consequences:
• Combined weight loss: 31.5 pounds total
  - Jim Lovell: 14 lbs
  - Jack Swigert: 5 lbs
  - Fred Haise: 6 lbs (+ kidney infection)
• Dehydration weakened crew for re-entry
• Recovery took weeks after splashdown

The Psychological Torture:
• Water available in CM (powered down, can't access)
• LM water limited (must last entire trip)
• Every drop counted
• Watching each other's consumption

=== POWER: EVERY AMP MATTERS ===
The Battery Crisis:

LM Battery Capacity:
• Designed for 45-hour lunar mission
• Now supporting 87+ hours (double!)
• Used for life support, navigation, communications

Power Budget:
• Calculated down to individual amps
• Every system evaluated: essential or not?
• Continuous monitoring of remaining power
• 20% remaining at splashdown (cutting it close!)

What Was Powered Down:
❌ Heaters (except critical components)
❌ Most cabin lights
❌ Non-essential electronics
❌ Communications (reduced to minimum)
❌ Guidance computer (except during burns)

What Stayed On:
✅ Life support (oxygen circulation)
✅ Minimal lighting (stumbling in dark)
✅ CO2 scrubbers (critical)
✅ Attitude control (spacecraft orientation)
✅ Communications (essential updates only)

The Communication Dilemma:
• Each radio transmission drains batteries
• Families desperate for updates
• Crew feels isolated
• Some silence periods: 6+ hours
• Mission Control flying blind

Radio Discipline:
• Essential updates only
• No casual conversation
• Families terrified during long silences
• Crew felt abandoned but understood

Battery Jump-Start (GET ~138:00:00):
• Transfer power from LM to CM
• Never tested before
• Risk of short-circuit
• Worked perfectly!
• Charged CM batteries for re-entry

=== FOOD: MINIMAL NUTRITION ===
The Food Problem:

Available Food:
• Freeze-dried packets
• Required water to prepare (don't have water!)
• Some "wet pack" foods available
• Limited variety

Consumption Reality:
• Hard to eat in extreme cold
• Dry food hard to swallow without water
• Stress kills appetite
• Forcing down calories

Nutrition Impact:
• Calorie deficit (burning more than eating)
• Weight loss from dehydration + malnutrition
• Weakened for re-entry tasks
• Mental fog from hunger + cold + stress

=== SLEEP: NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE ===
The Sleep Deprivation Crisis:

Why Sleep Was Impossible:
😴 Temperature too cold to relax
😴 Cramped quarters (moving wakes others)
😴 Constant stress and worry
😴 Uncomfortable in zero gravity
😴 Noise from systems and alarms
😴 Bright sunlight through windows
😴 No day/night cycle in space

Sleep Attempts:
• Brief naps (minutes, not hours)
• Never deep sleep
• Constantly startled awake
• Exhaustion building

Effects of Sleep Deprivation:
• Impaired judgment
• Slowed reactions
• Irritability
• Difficulty concentrating
• Mistakes more likely
• Dangerous during critical re-entry

Jim Lovell's Experience:
• Fourth spaceflight (used to discomfort)
• But worst conditions ever
• Pushed through on experience
• Leadership required alertness

Rookies Swigert & Haise:
• First spaceflight
• Expected Moon landing adventure
• Got survival nightmare instead
• Performed admirably under stress

=== OXYGEN: THE ONE BRIGHT SPOT ===
Oxygen Status:

LM Oxygen Supply:
✅ Sufficient for 3 people for journey
✅ CO2 scrubbers working (thanks to mailbox)
✅ Breathing not a problem (after mailbox fix)

Oxygen Storage:
• Stored in LM descent stage tanks
• Separate from damaged SM tanks
• Enough capacity for extended mission

The Relief:
• At least they could breathe
• CO2 controlled at ~4.6 mmHg (safe)
• One less thing to worry about

=== SPACE: CRAMPED QUARTERS ===
The Physical Constraints:

Lunar Module Interior:
• ~160 cubic feet (like walk-in closet)
• Designed for 2 standing astronauts
• Now holding 3 people
• NO SEATS (standing room only)

The Reality:
• Can't stretch out
• Bumping into each other constantly
• Moving disturbs everyone
• No privacy whatsoever
• Personal space: zero

Zero Gravity "Helps":
• Can float in any orientation
• Not standing on feet for days
• But still cramped
• Equipment everywhere

=== WASTE MANAGEMENT ===
The Uncomfortable Reality:

Bathroom Facilities:
• Urine collection bags
• Fecal collection bags
• No privacy
• Difficult in zero gravity

With Dehydration:
• Less urine (darker, concentrated)
• Uncomfortable but less frequent
• Fred Haise's kidney infection made it painful

The Psychological Toll:
• No privacy for 4+ days
• Three men in tiny space
• Personal hygiene impossible
• Just had to endure

=== CUMULATIVE EFFECTS ===
The Total Stress on Crew:

Physical:
❄️ Freezing temperature (38°F)
💧 Severe dehydration (6 oz water/day)
😴 Sleep deprivation (minimal sleep for 4+ days)
🍽️ Malnutrition (limited food)
🤒 Illness (Haise's kidney infection)
😰 Exhaustion (complete physical drain)

Mental:
🧠 Stress (life-or-death situation)
😟 Isolation (long radio silences)
😨 Fear (will we make it?)
🎯 Pressure (must execute perfectly)
😤 Frustration (constant discomfort)

Yet They Performed:
✅ Built mailbox adapter
✅ Executed navigation burns
✅ Monitored systems continuously
✅ Made critical decisions
✅ Stayed calm under pressure
✅ Landed safely

=== COMPARISON TO ENDURANCE RECORDS ===
Apollo 13 vs Other Extremes:

Antarctic Explorers:
• Have warm shelters
• Have adequate food and water
• Can move around
• Ground beneath feet

Mountain Climbers:
• Can turn back
• Rescue possible

=== THE HUMAN SPIRIT ===
What They Proved:

Humans Can Survive:
• 4+ days at 38°F
• Severe dehydration
• Complete sleep deprivation
• Extreme stress and fear
• Cramped, uncomfortable conditions

When Motivated By:
• Desire to live

=== THE RECOVERY ===
After Splashdown:

Immediate Medical Care:
• Rehydration (IV fluids)
• Warming (heated blankets)
• Rest (finally!)
• Medical monitoring

Recovery Time:
• Weeks to fully recover
• Fred Haise: Kidney infection treated
• Weight gain back to normal
• Psychological impact: lifelong

=== THE LESSON ===
The human body can endure incredible hardship.
The human spirit can overcome impossible odds.

When you have to survive,
You find a way.

When comfort isn't an option,
Endure.

When sleep is impossible,
Stay alert.

When water runs out,
Ration.

When it's freezing,
Shiver and continue.

Four days in hell.
Three men survived.

🥶 + 💧 + 😴 + 🚀 = 🏠

THEY MADE IT HOME.
