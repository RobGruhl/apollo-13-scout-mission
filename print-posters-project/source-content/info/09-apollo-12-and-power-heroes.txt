KEY SAVES: APOLLO 12 & THE POWER HEROES
"SCE to AUX" and the Team That Saved Apollo 13

=== TWO MISSIONS, ONE HERO ===
John Aaron — The EECOM Who Saved Two Missions

Apollo 12 (November 1969):
• Lightning strike during launch
• John Aaron: "SCE to AUX"
• Mission saved

Apollo 13 (April 1970):
• Explosion crippled spacecraft
• John Aaron: Led all power planning
• Crew saved

The Connection: Same engineer, same calm problem-solving, both times critical

=== APOLLO 12: "SCE TO AUX" ===
The Lightning Strike Crisis:

Launch Day — November 14, 1969:
• Apollo 12 lifts off in rainy weather
• 36.5 seconds after liftoff: LIGHTNING STRIKE #1
• A few seconds later: LIGHTNING STRIKE #2
• Both strikes hit the tall Saturn V rocket

What Happened:
• Every warning light in spacecraft turned ON
• Fuel cell gauges: crazy readings
• Electrical systems: total confusion
• Telemetry to ground: garbage data
• Computer displays: nonsense
• Crew: "We just lost the platform!"

In Mission Control:
• Screens showing chaos
• No one understands what's wrong
• Flight Director: considers ABORT
• Clock ticking: 10 seconds to decide
• Launch costs $375 million (1969 dollars)

John Aaron (EECOM — Electrical Systems):
• Sees strange pattern in data
• Remembers similar pattern from obscure test 1 year earlier
• Makes the call...

The Miracle Words:
John Aaron: "Flight, try SCE to AUX."

Flight Director: "What?"

John Aaron: "SCE to AUX!"

CapCom (to crew): "Apollo 12, Houston. Try SCE to AUX."

Pete Conrad (Commander): "SCE to what??"

Alan Bean (Lunar Module Pilot):
• Remembers the switch from training
• Tiny switch, rarely used
• Panel 16, under his hand
• Flips it to AUXILIARY

Result:
✅ Telemetry instantly restored
✅ Data flowing to Mission Control
✅ Systems reading normally
✅ Mission continues
✅ Successful Moon landing!

What "SCE to AUX" Did:
• SCE = Signal Conditioning Electronics
• Normal mode overloaded by lightning surge
• AUX mode used backup signal path
• Cleared the electrical confusion
• Simple switch flip = mission saved

The Legend Begins:
• John Aaron became famous
• "Steely-eyed missile man" (Gene Kranz)
• Calm under pressure
• Knew obscure switch from memory
• Saved $375 million mission in 10 seconds

=== APOLLO 13: JOHN AARON'S POWER LEADERSHIP ===
After the Explosion — April 13, 1970:

The Crisis:
• Oxygen tanks damaged
• Fuel cells offline
• Running on batteries only
• Limited power for 4+ days
• Must manage every single amp

Gene Kranz's Decision:
• Flight Director Gene Kranz had ultimate authority
• But he knew: This is a power/consumables problem
• John Aaron (EECOM) was the best

The Order:
Flight Director Gene Kranz put John Aaron in charge of:
✅ ALL power management for BOTH spacecraft
✅ ALL consumables (oxygen, water, batteries)
✅ VETO authority over checklist items
✅ Final say on what systems stay on/off

Translation: If John Aaron said "No power for that," it didn't happen.

Why This Mattered:
• Normally, many people share authority
• Flight Director decides most things
• But Kranz trusted Aaron completely
• Gave him full power control
• One person = clear decisions

=== THE POWER TEAM ===
Key Players Saving Apollo 13:

John Aaron (EECOM):
• In charge of all electrical and environmental systems
• Led all power and consumables planning
• Veto authority over procedures
• Made final calls on power budget

Arnie Aldrich:
• Kept the master checklists
• Documented every procedure
• Made sure nothing was forgotten
• Coordinated between teams

Bill Peters:
• Led work to turn LM into "survival vehicle"
• Figured out how to make LM support 3 for 4+ days
• Designed power-down procedures
• Created LM lifeboat operations

Jim Kelly:
• Led the battery charging procedure
• Figured out how to charge CM from LM
• Never attempted before in space
• Worked with Bill Peters on procedures

The Team Effort:
• John Aaron shaped overall power strategy
• Bill Peters made LM a lifeboat
• Jim Kelly solved battery charging
• Arnie Aldrich kept everything organized
• Hundreds of engineers supported them

=== CHARGING CM BATTERIES FROM LM ===
The Never-Before-Attempted Procedure:

The Problem (GET ~122-126):
• Command Module batteries at 2% (nearly dead)
• Need full power for re-entry computers and parachutes
• Lunar Module has remaining battery power
• Must transfer power LM → CM
• Never tested, could short-circuit and kill both systems

Mission Control's Solution:
• John Aaron continued shaping entry power-up plan
• Jim Kelly led the actual charging procedure
• Bill Peters helped with LM systems
• Team designed step-by-step process in real-time
• Radioed instructions to crew

The Execution:
1. Connect LM batteries to CM charging system
2. Carefully monitor voltage and current
3. Watch for short-circuits or overheating
4. Charge CM batteries enough for re-entry
5. Disconnect before anything fails

The Moment:
• Crew followed instructions precisely
• Power flowing from LM to CM
• One battery briefly "dropped off the line" (scary!)
• But it came back online
• Charging successful!

Result:
✅ CM batteries charged to sufficient levels
✅ Re-entry computers have power
✅ Parachutes will deploy
✅ Crew can come home
✅ Procedure added to NASA emergency playbook

Without This:
• Dead CM batteries = no re-entry computer
• No computer = can't hit re-entry corridor
• Can't hit corridor = skip off or burn up
• Battery charging made survival possible

=== POWER BUDGET MANAGEMENT ===
Every Amp Mattered:

The Challenge:
• LM batteries designed for 45-hour Moon landing
• Apollo 13 needed 87+ hours (nearly double!)
• Every system drains power
• Run out = death

John Aaron's Decisions:
What Stayed ON:
✅ Life support (oxygen circulation)
✅ Minimal cabin lights (just enough to see)
✅ CO2 scrubbers (must breathe)
✅ Attitude control (point spacecraft correctly)
✅ Essential communications (but reduced!)

What Turned OFF:
❌ Heaters (temperature dropped to 38°F)
❌ Most cabin lights (stumbling in dark)
❌ Non-essential electronics
❌ High-power radio amplifier (used backup)
❌ Guidance computer (except during burns)

The Result:
• Batteries lasted entire journey
• 20% power remaining at splashdown
• Extremely close call
• But they made it!

=== THE ENTRY POWER-UP PLAN ===
John Aaron's Final Challenge:

The Problem (GET ~141:30):
• Must power up Command Module for re-entry
• Frozen at 38°F for 4 days
• Condensation everywhere
• Guidance computer not designed for shutdown/restart
• Normal startup: 3 hours
• Time available: 2 hours
• Must work first time or crew dies

John Aaron's Plan:
• Designed careful power-up sequence
• Every step calculated for minimum power use
• Every system brought online in precise order
• Built-in checks to detect problems early
• Crew could abort sequence if needed

The Systems:
1. Heaters (warm up critical components)
2. Guidance computer (frozen for 4 days)
3. Navigation platform (must align)
4. Life support (oxygen, cooling)
5. Communications (stay in touch)
6. Parachute systems (arm for deployment)

The Execution:
• Crew followed Aaron's procedure exactly
• Systems came online one by one
• Guidance computer restarted (miracle!)
• Navigation aligned successfully
• All systems GO for re-entry

Result:
✅ Power-up completed in 2 hours
✅ Computer worked despite being frozen
✅ Perfect re-entry
✅ Safe splashdown
✅ All three crew alive

=== THE HEROES BEHIND THE HEROES ===
While Crew Was in Space:

Mission Control (Working 24/7):
• Engineers sleeping in shifts
• Coffee and determination
• Simulating every procedure
• Testing every step on the ground
• Radioing final instructions to crew

The Unsung Team:
• John Aaron (power genius)
• Bill Peters (LM survival expert)
• Jim Kelly (battery charging)
• Arnie Aldrich (master checklist keeper)
• Hundreds of engineers
• Simulator crews
• Test pilots
• Mathematicians

No Single Hero:
• Crew executed perfectly
• Mission Control planned perfectly
• Everyone trusted each other
• Teamwork saved three lives

=== DID YOU KNOW? ===
Amazing Facts:

Apollo 12 Lightning:
• Both strikes within 40 seconds of launch
• Saturn V rocket acted like lightning rod
• Rocket kept flying perfectly (no damage to engines)
• Electrical systems confused but recoverable
• Only mission hit by lightning during launch

• Alan Bean found SCE switch from memory
• Located on Panel 16 (not main panel)
• Rarely used in training
• Bean: "I remembered because it was so unusual"

John Aaron's Memory:
• Remembered pattern from test 1 year earlier
• Test was just practice, not real mission
• But he filed it away mentally
• Recognized it instantly under pressure
• 10 seconds to make the call

Apollo 13 Power Budget:
• Every single system calculated to the amp
• Margins so tight that extra radio call could matter
• 20% battery remaining = less than 1 hour of power left
• If re-entry took 10 minutes longer, might have died
• Perfect planning made survival possible

=== QUOTES TO REMEMBER ===
Words from the Heroes:

Gene Kranz (on John Aaron):
"John Aaron is a steely-eyed missile man."
(Highest compliment in Mission Control)

John Aaron (on both missions):
"I just did my job. The crew did the hard part."

Alan Bean (Apollo 12):
"I don't know what that switch does, but I know where it is!"
(After flipping SCE to AUX)

Pete Conrad (Apollo 12):
"I think we got hit by lightning!"
(Understatement of the mission)

Jim Lovell (Apollo 13):
"The guys on the ground saved us. We just followed instructions."

=== THE LEGACY ===
How These Saves Changed NASA:

From Apollo 12:
✅ Never launch in lightning conditions (new rule)
✅ Weather constraints tightened
✅ Backup signal paths better understood
✅ Obscure switches now part of main training

From Apollo 13:
✅ Power management procedures documented
✅ Battery charging procedures added
✅ LM as lifeboat validated
✅ One person in charge of consumables (better than committee)

From Both:
✅ Trust the experts
✅ Train for impossible scenarios
✅ Calm problem-solving saves lives
✅ Knowledge + experience = survival

=== THE FINAL LESSON ===
Two Missions. One Engineer. Same Calm.

Apollo 12: "SCE to AUX" → Mission saved in 10 seconds
Apollo 13: Power leadership → Crew saved over 4 days

Different problems.
Same principles:
✅ Know your stuff
✅ Stay calm
✅ Trust the team
✅ Work the problem

John Aaron and his team:
• Didn't panic
• Used their training
• Made hard calls
• Saved lives
