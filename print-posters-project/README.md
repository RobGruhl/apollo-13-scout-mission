# Print Posters Project - UNFINISHED

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è On hold pending format decision
**Last Updated:** October 2025
**Decision Maker:** Ed Gruhl, Scout District Commissioner

---

## Current Situation

The **interactive web version is COMPLETE** and live at:
üåê **https://robgruhl.github.io/apollo-mission/**

This directory contains materials for a **print/static version** that was started but not completed.

---

## Ed's Pending Decision

**Format options:**

- **Option A: Binder Format**
  - Print 8.5"√ó11" copies (20 sets)
  - Distribute in binders to scouts
  - Simpler, lower cost
  - Could print directly from web slides

- **Option B: Poster Format**
  - Print large 2'√ó3' posters (24 total)
  - Bring easel to jamboree booth
  - More visual impact
  - Higher cost, needs transport

**Status:** Not yet decided. Waiting on Ed's preference and budget.

---

## What's Here

### üìÑ `/prototype/`
Contains the **design template** for poster format:
- `02-decision-freeze-or-squeeze.html` - One completed poster layout
- This was the visual/layout prototype for all 24 posters
- Side-by-side design: 40% diagrams, 60% text/PROS/CONS
- Target size: 36"√ó24" (3600√ó2400px)

**Status:** Single prototype complete, design not applied to other 23 posters

---

### üìù `/source-content/`
Contains **text content** for all 24 posters:

```
source-content/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ decision/     (10 files) - Crisis decision points with PROS/CONS
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ narrative/    (6 files)  - Story progression slides
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ info/         (8 files)  - Technical background slides
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/       (27MB)     - Source images (many duplicates of assets/images/)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ COMPLETE_NARRATIVE.txt   - All content combined for readability
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md     - Content organization guide
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Problem:** Text is likely **too verbose** for poster format
- Written for detailed reading, not poster scanning
- Needs editing/condensing before layout
- Target: Readable from 6 feet away

---

### üóÇÔ∏è `/original-materials/`
Contains **source files** before processing:

- `Apollo_13_Educational_Materials.docx` (22MB) - Complete combined document
- `2026-NSJ-Patch.png` - Jamboree patch
- `apollo_13_scout_cover.png` - Cover image
- `patch.png` - Apollo 13 mission patch
- `generate_docx.py` - Script to generate/export .docx

**Purpose:** Historical archive, human-readable reference

## Next Steps (When Ed Decides)

### If Option A: Binder Format (8.5√ó11)
1. **Easiest approach:** Print directly from web browser
   - Navigate to each slide: `https://robgruhl.github.io/apollo-mission/slides/`
   - Print to PDF or paper
   - Bind in order

2. **Alternative:** Create print-optimized HTML
   - Remove navigation elements
   - Optimize for black & white printing
   - Add page numbers and header/footer

### If Option B: Poster Format (2√ó3 feet)
1. **Complete poster layouts** (23 remaining)
   - Apply prototype design to all slides
   - Use `/source-content/` text files as source
   - **Condense text** - posters need brevity

2. **Design for distance viewing**
   - Readable from 6 feet away
   - Larger fonts, less text
   - More visual hierarchy

3. **High-resolution graphics**
   - Current images are web-optimized (~1200px wide)
   - Need 300 DPI for 2√ó3 foot prints
   - May need to re-source images from NASA archives

4. **Export for print**
   - PDF at 3600√ó2400px (36"√ó24" at 100 DPI)
   - Or higher resolution for professional printing

## Questions to Resolve

Before continuing this project:

1. **Format decision:** Binders or posters?
2. **Budget:** What's available for printing?
3. **Quantity:** How many scouts expected at booth?
4. **Transport:** Can large posters/easel be transported to venue?
5. **Interactive vs. static:** Should scouts use website instead?
