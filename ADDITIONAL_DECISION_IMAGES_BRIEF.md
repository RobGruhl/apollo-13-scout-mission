# Additional Decision Slides - Image Requirements Brief
**Project:** Apollo 13 Interactive Experience - Expansion
**Date:** 2025-10-04
**Purpose:** Locate images for 6 unimplemented decision slides

---

## Context

The interactive site currently has 4 decision slides (out of 10 planned). This brief covers images needed for the remaining 6 decision points that exist as text files but were never implemented as interactive slides.

**If implemented, these would add 6 more decision slides to the experience.**

- `slide09_earth_terminator.jpg` (185KB) - Earth terminator view

**Status:** Ready to use, no new images needed

---

### ‚úÖ Decision #10: Computer Restart vs Manual

**Existing Image (USED on Slide 16):**
- `slide21_computer_restart.png` (156KB) - Apollo Guidance Computer

**Options:**

## Decision Slide Content Summary

For reference when searching images:

### Decision #3: Stars or Sun/Earth Navigation
- **Dilemma:** Debris field makes stars invisible
- **Options:** Use star sighting (accurate but blocked) vs Sun/Earth alignment (less accurate but visible)
- **Images needed:** ‚úÖ Have AOT and Earth terminator

### Decision #5: Water Conservation
- **Dilemma:** Not enough water for crew + electronics + breathing
- **Options:** Equal rationing vs prioritize drinking vs prioritize cooling
- **Images needed:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Have water rationing (used elsewhere)

### Decision #6: PC+2 Burn (Speed Up)
- **Dilemma:** Current trajectory lands in wrong ocean, too far from rescue
- **Options:** Coast on free-return vs perform risky engine burn to retarget
- **Images needed:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Have LM engine (unused)

### Decision #7: Communication Discipline
- **Dilemma:** Radio uses precious battery power
- **Options:** Maintain frequent contact (comfort/safety) vs radio silence (save power)
- **Images needed:** ‚ùå NEED radio/communication equipment

### Decision #8: Battery Jump-Start
- **Dilemma:** CM batteries at 2%, need power for re-entry
- **Options:** Use 2% reserve (certain death) vs jump-start from LM (untested, risky)
- **Images needed:** ‚ùå NEED battery/electrical panel

### Decision #9: SM Jettison Timing
- **Dilemma:** When to jettison damaged Service Module?
- **Options:** Early jettison (see damage, but risks exposure) vs late jettison (standard but less time to react)
- **Images needed:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Have SM damage image, could use SM jettison sequence

### Decision #10: Computer Restart vs Manual
- **Dilemma:** Frozen computer might not restart
- **Options:** Risk computer restart vs manual re-entry (extremely difficult)
- **Images needed:** ‚úÖ Have AGC computer image

## Next Steps

1. **Priority 1:** Find radio/communication image
2. **Priority 2:** Find battery/electrical panel image
3. **Optional:** Find better engine firing and water supply images
4. **Decision:** Whether to implement these 6 additional decision slides
