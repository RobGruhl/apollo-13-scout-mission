## 🎯 Project Goals Achieved

From your original request:
> "Create a simple walkthrough that scouts can access using a QR code as either a leave behind or an optional version for them to go through."

✅ **Simple walkthrough**: Clean, intuitive navigation
✅ **QR code accessible**: Ready for QR deployment
✅ **Leave behind**: Scouts can revisit anytime
✅ **Optional version**: Complements physical posters

> "This will need to be hosted inexpensively and securely with cloud usage price cap inherent to it."

✅ **Inexpensive**: $0/month (GitHub Pages free tier)
✅ **Securely hosted**: HTTPS included, GitHub infrastructure
✅ **Price cap inherent**: Free tier has no overage charges

> "It's going to be read only, probably static pages using HTML."

✅ **Read only**: No user accounts, no data entry
✅ **Static pages**: Pure HTML/CSS/JS, no backend
✅ **Using HTML**: Modern, semantic HTML5

> "The interactive version will likely have either a lot less content or perhaps the content will be kind of clickable to learn more about specific aspects."

✅ **Less content**: ~40% of poster content per slide
✅ **Clickable details**: Accordion sections, expandable "Learn More"
✅ **Specific aspects**: Decision reveals, info expandables
